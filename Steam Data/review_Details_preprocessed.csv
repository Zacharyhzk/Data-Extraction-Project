planet afflicted endless war survival considering pcf last work bulletstorm expecting much regarding narrative however delight outrider well written engaging story accompanied dense lore excellent world building fond took turn title went serious mature approach every character distinct personality purpose dark theme depicted plot clear writer surpassed time gameplayonce devs nailed combat system thought exceed work bulletstorm combat system outrider proved wrong game fast paced fluid brutal combat mingled sort overpowered ability far highlight gameplay experience game time made feel like powerful right beginning adventure felt like demigod teleporting behind enemy slashing energy sword gunplay also magnificent light machine gun sidearms every weapon feel authentic pleasant handle

gameplay playing pcf previous title really hoping see superior level design outrider though presume hope vain level restrictive following old fashioned design akin traditional third person shooter gear war spec ops line even recent title remnant ash time simply running straight line advancing combat arena towards objective first thought bad since third person shooter usually work similarly however end game felt like essentially played level repeatedly hour utterly wearing even limited level design game considerable amount thing place explore first game pretty rewarding exploration

fancy creating sort build great feature performance issue pc specsgpu rtx cpu ryzen x ram gb outrider significant problem concerning difficulty balancing difficulty well loot tied world tier hence higher tier better loot tougher enemy mechanic problem quite contrary reasonably compelling serf encourage play higher difficulty setting however execution pretty awful game higher tier totally broken thoroughly unfair evident playing solo example lost count many time got one shot sniper superhuman reflex health leeched second random enemy scout unbalanced becomes frustrating know fact one concern many people included regarding game similar outrider played solo fortunately yes nevertheless mean designed title enough thought single player experience starter offline mode outrider always required connected server playing something troublesome every server eventually go maintenance issue making impossible play even sadly recurrent issue end journey tired getting kicked game session seeing internet connection error message unfortunately seem like devs implement offline mode anytime soon ever recently bought planning purchasing title better hold tight endure tiring endless disconnect thought outrider issue bad news entire game bug fest several minor glitch aggravating game breaking bug range crucial cutscene sound inaccessible quest area invincible enemy even whole progress wiped throughout time playing outrider encountered almost every kind bug present game infuriated constant crashing already lost count many time saw stupid bird flying across screen entering game crash performance wise game lack polish stable frame rate throughout playthrough usually run around fps huge stutterings dragging frame rate causing game unplayable time conclusionoutriders everything one best game genre amazing gunplay entertaining narrative exciting class system really liked recommend however afflicted many issue questionable design choice game fails deliver solid remarkable
