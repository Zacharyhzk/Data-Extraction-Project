																I have been waiting for this moment. After playing for 150 hours and having completed all acts on Recruit, Veteran and Nightmare difficulties, I can finally write a quality review.First I would like to state that the game is good. But there's a lot of things that always make me sick while playing it. And that's why I'm giving this game a thumbs down. I enjoy playing this game but there's always something that causes me to go into a deep state of annoyance, hence I cannot recommend this game. I want to feel happy when I play videogames, I don't feel happy when I play this game, at all.-Difficulty scaling. As we all know (well, the people who play this game), difficulty scaling is so badly designed in this game. Recruit is too easy and Veteran-Nightmare are too hard. No matter what you say, this is a fact. And you can’t argue against facts and statistics. A very low percentage of players have completed this game on Veteran/Nightmare judging from the achievement statistics. I have no clue what the devs were thinking when they were implementing these difficulties. The “Corruption cards” and absolutely disgusting special ridden spawn rate makes it even worse.-The meta. As some of you know there's already a meta in this game. What is it you may ask? Speed decks. People use speed decks to complete the absolute abomination of a difficulty like Nightmare. The difficulty is so unbalanced and random ( a lot of RNG elements like “Corruption cards” or 5 “Tallboys” spawning in your face ), that it is close to impossible to complete it without speed decks. You need a lot of luck as well. This kinda takes away the whole point of the game - slaying zombies. But playing without speed decks on Nightmare mode will just make your day worse and not worth your time since it's absurdly broken.-RNG. This game is heavily dependent on RNG (especially in Veteran and Nightmare). I have never, ever played a zombie game that was so RNG based. “Corruption cards” are your worst enemies and can cost you a lot of wasted time and resets. It just feels so wrong when a Breaker spawns in the worst possible time + if you have acid zombies + running zombies + armored Stingers/Hockers + Tallboy hordes (HAHA) + all the other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Or you die just because a Hocker snipes you and as you may know, it's often not possible to dodge their aimbot spit or 5 Tallboys spawn in your face. And that's why we come to the next point:-Special Ridden and Spawn Rate. This game's special ridden spawn rate is absolutely disgusting. Multiple specials can spawn in your face and you can't do anything about it but die. Or survive but get a ♥♥♥♥ ton of trauma and not want to continue the campaign at that point because it’s useless and a waste of time.-Tallboy and Crusher grab range. These guys can still hit/grab you when you are 10 miles away.-Lagging ridden/bad servers. Every time I play this game I experience some kind of weird ridden-teleporting-lag. And that's not just me, everyone who I play with experiences the same thing. Apparently, if you go too fast, ridden fail to load in to the map properly and they start stuttering. Looks terrible and they literally can teleport on top of you and kill you.-Friend invite and friend list system. Okay, this is a very small thing but still is very annoying. If you want to invite someone you have to add them as a friend to do so. I find that very inconvenient. Also, your in-game friend list is not sorted in alphabetical order (seriously, devs?).-Stats do not properly display. Example: “ZWAT” skin. To get the “ZWAT” skin for each character you need to complete all acts on Nightmare with that particular character. You cannot see anywhere which acts have you done and which acts you are missing.-Ultimate Edition. The ultimate edition is honestly such a big waste of money. You get some cheap, totally unoriginal weapon skins (green camo - seriously, devs?) and some character skins that look almost the same as the original skins. I am shocked about the fact how unoriginal the devs are.-Glitches/exploits. There are some game breaking exploits in this game that have been around since the game first released as early access. Examples: card duplication, infinite copper, map skips.-No ""kick player"" button for the lobby host. Again, seriously devs? I just can't comprehend anymore.-Server regions. I am from Europe and if I am the host, the game should always put me in European servers. If I play with 1 American, it puts us in an American server even if I'm the host. Same thing goes with Singapore... like.. I am completely done at this point.-Checkpoint system. You play Nightmare. You get to the last mission and fail on that particular mission both times, running out of continues. You have to restart from the very first mission just because you failed on the last one and you can't even practise the last mission more in order to gain more knowledge and possibly think of new strats. You have to start from the VERY BEGINNING.  If you play without speed decks, you're going to be completely washed up after this.-Bad progression system. It's 2021 and they failed to implement a somewhat decent leveling/prestige system. After 100 hours you can pretty much get every single cosmetic item in this game and after that there's nothing really to grind for, except the ""ZWAT"" outfits maybe.-No true fullscreen mode setting in the in-game settings. You need to edit a .ini file to make your game go into true fullscreen. I don’t understand the reason behind this.This game can be amazing, but it needs some heavy polishing.",Not Recommended

																Now I like this game. Feels like left 4 dead but modern and fresh. The only reason I’m not recommending it is because you are basically penalized for playing solo campaign. You do not earn any currency or progression by playing solo and I don’t agree with that. Not everyone wants to play a game like this with people and progression towards currency and achievements, etc. should not be locked for doing so.",Not Recommended

Back 4 Blood,"Posted: 26 October
																I wish I could give this game a mixed option. I love co-op games so much in the classic Left 4 Dead style, and I do enjoy this game. The gun play is a lot of fun and there's a lot more weapons to choose from than in classic titles.But here's the problem; I play solo on almost everything. I suffer from adulthood, so when I'm done with work for the day, I don't want to spend two hours trying to find teammates that are more invested in the game than racial slurs. The bots in this game are GOD AWFUL. In Easy difficulty, you can plow through the first half of the game, but the second half starts to get sticky with the AI. The first half on Medium difficulty is a good challenge, but the second half is practically unbeatable. The bots are constantly walking directly into your line of fire, getting stuck on everything, they don't heal when you ever actually need it, and good luck playing with any melee builds.Also, you're not allowed to unlock anything when you play solo. Cards, cosmetics, achievements, etc.Why are the devs punishing players for playing alone? Not everybody has groups of friends available to play games, especially by the time you're actually old enough to buy this game.Another aspect that irked me was how uninteresting the level design is. None of these maps are very memorable. Many levels start in the same ""hub world"" area with little variety as you progress towards the ""fresh"" maps. There were a couple of maps that were pretty cool, but for the most part, it's all pretty copy/paste, especially when you compare it to the contrast of classic titles.If they fix the AI and the solo progression, I'll gladly update this, but for now I'd wait for a sale. Especially if you play alone.",Not Recommended

Warning #1: Do not expect this to be Left 4 Dead 3. If you expect this, you are setting yourself up for some disappointment. It also restricts progression if you play it solo.Warning #2: You are paying $60 for the current version of the game. Turtle Rock has promised that microtransactions will be ""cosmetic only"" -- they neglect to clearly clarify that they don't consider DLC campaigns to be microtransactions. You will have to pay more for new campaigns in the future, unless you play with someone who has bought them -- in which case, you'll be forced to download and store GB's of data you cannot even use when playing solo.Warning #3: All your in-game voice chat is recorded for moderation. If this bothers you, please refrain from using it entirely. The game will provide an early warning.Warning #4: It is heresy for any self-proclaimed ""Left 4 Dead spiritual successor"" to be as anti-modding as Back 4 Blood is. I respect that Turtle Rock Studios just wanted to create a great game -- and they've succeeded -- but not without Phil Robb and Chris Ashton betraying their roots. Left 4 Dead and Valve cultivated a vibrant community of modders many of whom now work in the industry -- whereas Back 4 Blood stifles cultivation.Warner Bros' aggressive anti-modding terms are a regression, not a progression.That being said, on its own it's a solid game with countless great qualities:+ Beautiful art direction, from environments to characters, and lighting+ The user interface design is alarmingly smooth and clean, extensive color blind options+ Map clipping seems unobtrusive and parkour, you will have fun running around+ The guns are great, and being able to use them all in Fort Hope right away is also cool+ Fort Hope's boxing area and jukebox are great details, but would benefit from more places of utility in future updatesThere's clearly a lot of well-meaning love that went into this game, even if questionable decisions were made. It's now just a matter of the community keeping future decisions in check -- since we won't be able to do any of that ourselves with mods.For mods, look up Chet Faliszek's ""Anacrusis"" Discord server -- those are the other ex-L4D devs who actually care.",Recommended

Back 4 Blood,"Posted: 12 October
																After about 50 hours in the open beta and 40 in the final release, I feel comfortable saying it's a pretty good game.Jokes aside, there are some valid criticisms to be made. The easiest difficulty is incredibly easy, and the next is significantly harder. This difficulty curve really feels like it punishes individual players who don't have a group of friends to play with. It's a very team-oriented game, and to call playing with randoms oonline""hit or miss"" is being generous.On the topic of the team gameplay, the recruit difficulty does very little to prepare you for just how team-oriented the game is. If you play this like you would play Left 4 Dead, where all the characters are interchangeable and you don't need to worry too much about weapon types or skills each player uses, you can beat recruit fairly easily, but you will never beat the other modes. However, since many people will begin on recruit and see these strategies work, it won't be apparent just how important player specialisation is. It can give players who start there a false sense of how they should play the game and set them up for frustration later.Finally, one of my biggest complaints is the continue system. It is unnecessarily punishing without contributing virtually anything to the fun of the game. I can recognise that some players may value the challenge, but forcing us to replay multiple levels because of some bad RNG feels like bad design, especially on recruit & veteran. I would disable it if I could, and hope that a future patch will make this an option.Besides these points, however, I find the game incredibly fun with a high degree of replayability. There are definitely some things I could suggest to improve it, but, overall, I think it's a very solid experience. Advice for new players:- Start on recruit. Some people will say it's bad, too easy, or less fun, but in the later acts it can still be a challenge. Plus it's a great way to unlock some cards before trying the harder difficulty.- Decks matter, and the order of the decks matter. You draw the cards in order every time, so space them out accordingly. You can see ahead of time what missions you'll have and, assuming 1 card per mission, you can tell when you'll draw a certain card. Use this to your advantage to get the cards you need right when you need them.- Team specialisation is incredibly important. I don't just mean a bit of difference; I mean complete separation of roles. There are 4 types of weapon, and your team should have one of each. Whichever you are using, go all-in. A jack-of-all-trades build sounds good on paper, but you will pay for it in harder difficulties. - Play to your team's strengths. There are already a lot of people claiming expertise or saying there is a certain way you have to play, but that's entirely wrong. You can customise to your heart's content, and just because something works for them doesn't mean it will work for you. Using their strats or decks can be a good starting point, and may even work well, but you should not believe anyone presenting them as the ""best"" or the only ""correct"" build. Tweak it until it works for *you.*Most importantly though:- Have fun. It's just a game. Don't grind too hard or take it too seriously. The progression is the point, and having fewer things unlocked just gives you things to look forward to. You aren't worse for it, and everyone's been where you are, so don't stress and enjoy the game.",Recommended

																There are no videos in this FIFA 22 page at the time I'm writing this review, because those new technologies that EA advertised in YouTube videos  (Hypermotion, etc)  are ONLY AVAILABLE IN NEXT-GEN CONSOLES, not in PC. Basically if those videos were in this page, it would be false advertising and you could apply for a refund even after 100hs. That's why they need to make new vids different from the ones they have in YT. Do not trust me, but also don't trust the blissful ignorance of those guys giving the game a thumbs up. We PC players are being charged the same money as console players, but we're getting a watered down old-gen version of FIFA (FIFA 2019 with minor changes, like CR7 in Manchester United, etc). Just look at the the recommended specs and file size of FIFA 22, they are the same specs as the last 3 FIFAs from past years (requires 50GB, 39GB after download, i5 recommended & 8gb of ram). This is not the first time it happens, same thing happened last year with FIFA 21, in PC they launched the game missing features, so it might happen again in FIFA 23, mark my words.  When media outlets asked EA about this, they said & I quote:  we don't want people with low-spec PCs missing the ability to play FIFA 22.  They also said that they weren't interested in adding those missing features in a future patch. IMHO you shouldn't support this copy-paste business at all, but if you still want more reasons:  EA has DISABLED ""Remote Play Together"", so you won't be able to invite your friends & play remotely, instead each one of you will have to pay $60. (Game publishers in Steam have the ability to enable or disable this feature).  This game will be added to Xbox Gamepass (PC) 6 months after launch (April 2022), so why'd you buy it now if you can just get it for $1 in 6 months? (monthly) No cross-play, this means it will take a lot of time to find online matches after some months, so prepare for high ping depending on your region.  EA TRIED to introduce a ""1 machine activation limit""[www.thegamer.com] DRM with FIFA 22, thankfully they reverted it after A LOT OF backlash from their users, they said ""it was an error from Steam"".  Goalkeepers are dumber than before & they can't deal with finesse shots from a far distance, so the gameplay doesn't reward great crosses, passes, etc. Just shoot from a far distance & you'll score. If you're too close you won't. Hitting ""Play"" in Steam launches Origin. Then Origin launches FIFA 22, then FIFA 22 launches a sort of mini-launcher in which you'll have to click ""Play"" again, otherwise the game won't start. Doesn't bother me but it makes me think: Why is it published in Steam, if we'll end up using Origin? Does people just accept these things after throwing $60 for a copy-pasted game that will be purposely outdated after a year? My advice: just get   Xbox Gamepass (PC) only for only $1 dollar (new users only) & it includes EA Play Basic. [www.xbox.com]  This will inmeadiatly give you access to FIFA 21, FIFA 20, and other games like Back 4 blood, etc for a whole month but also access to a 10 hour trial of FIFA 22 as soon as you bought it, plus access to the full game in April 2022. But if you REALLY want to play FIFA 22 so badly, just get EA Play PRO for a single month($15), it gives you UNLIMITED access to FIFA 22 for a whole month & also unlimited access to BATTLEFIELD 2042(plus early access). Just don't spend $60 in this game at all, rather buy EA Play Pro for 1 month to try things out.",Not Recommended

																Okay, so I am just going to use this as a platform to go off on a tangent regarding EA and not actually review the game (because it is the same damn game every year any ways) itself.

There is NO excuse for us PC gamers to not have next-gen technology. We have far superior hardware than any console - YOU GAVE NEXT-GEN TO GOOGLE STADIA!? - out there and we are more than capable of running the game just fine; your argument of: ""But we found that most FIFA players on PC do not have good enough PCs to run next-gen"" is completely void because the beauty of PC is that you have options! Give us the option to choose. If you have a good enough PC, there is no reason you should not be able to go into the settings and completely max out the graphics with next-gen technology. This argument - excuse rather - is nothing but a lazy cover up. Also, I just want to add the fact that you charge as much as you do for this game and you can not even introduce Brentford's stadium to the game is nothing short of a disgrace and an embarrassment. You did the exact same thing last year with Leeds when they got promoted. Prior to that, you would always add the stadium of the team that got promoted to the Premier League. Now you do not even do that. You make billions every single year exploiting football fans and our love for the sport. Have some shame. To make matters worse, your launch on Steam has been atrocious just like last time. People are paying over 80 dollars or more in local currency for Ultimate Edition and they were not able to play the game until today.

Launch ReviewDo not buy Battlefield 2042DICE\EA know how to make a “Battlefield” game.DICE\EA made trailers that promoted this game.    >  DICE\EA inserted all the “only in Battlefield” moments in to the TrailerDICE\EA knew that this game is missing all of the below features.DICE\EA still released this.A lot of the missing features come from a reddit post, I added a list of my ""Broken"" experiences.

																I bought the $110 version of the game I played it for 2 days the went to go long on the 3rd day after finishing up a paper then im greeted by a message of you're banned I go to EAs website to find out I was apparently cheating. Later I found out it was a false positive ban and was Razer Synapse that caused it. Went to go appeal for a ban but thats never going to happen. So i basically got $110 stolen from me thanks EA ♥♥♥♥ you",Not Recommended

																This game is meant to sell, not play. They invested all of their efforts into things like pointless weather effects and completely unnecessary scale so they could use them as selling points instead of investing in gameplay. And because of that ridiculous scale, they decided to throw in as many vehicle as possible without thinking of balancing them, Again to use the spectacle as a selling point.They swapped classes, a battlefield staple, for specialists because they would be easier to monetize. They got rid of so many great details and gameplay additions from old battlefields, so they could focus on making the game more sellable, not playable.They practically got rid of all sense of community by getting rid of voip, scoreboards, clans, and all chat.And not to mention how absolutely horrible the performance is. I am fortunate enough to have a pretty solid pc, (10900k, 3080) i get constant stutters ranging from 50 to 90 fps on settings meant for performance. I cant imagine how they expect people who have been getting screwed over by scalpers from getting components to play this game.The ONLY redeemable thing about this game is portal. It offers a great nostalgia trip and has a lot of potential. Unfortunately since people went straight to abusing it which i have no clue how dice didn't see that coming, its basically impossible to level up with right now.I could honestly go on but i think the part that is the most disappointing thing about all of this is that this game was labeled as ""a love letter to fans"" before it was even revealed, yet here they are ignoring feedback on what fans want.",Not Recommended

 Battlefield 2042 Review Firstly, personally I think It's sad people defend this game. I WANT this game to be good, very badly, I did spend $140 AUD for the ultimate edition since the beta felt really good, better than this main release somehow. So I've been here playing the base game for a while, and now you don't have to spend any money. I played 30 hours so YOU don't have to. Firstly I don't care about $140, to the people in the comments, you manage your money and I'll manage mine, you're not my accountant. Based on the 3000 + helpful votes I've stopped over 100+ people spending money on this game so It's 100% worth it, I've made EA and Dice lose more money I than I've given them (Not that they'd care), use common sense before you comment. Will also attach some videos down the bottom to show / prove what I talk about in this review.This game has much potential, but in its current state it’s frustrating, badly optimised and doesn’t function as it should. Most of the time when I'm shooting I feel like a stormtrooper. I often find this game being more annoying than exciting with the current build and bugs. This should not have been released yet in my honest opinion, I'll elaborate further after the pros and cons and attach short video proof of the issues I am experiencing.Pros:1.	Has great potential2.	Gun play feels ""okay""3.	Has a decently classic battlefield feel4.	Funny ♥♥♥♥ happens here and there, as it should with battlefield5.     You can do cool stuff like the previous games (For example wingsuit, cancel it mid-air, pull out a launcher and blast someone, then continue to wingsuit again I'll attach a video down the bottom of what I mean)Cons:1.	Bloom, the bloom is horrible, just find out yourself if you dare. Bloom takes away any skill and makes fights come down to luck which is just horrible for anyone who is half decent at aiming.2.	Hit registration doesn’t work (Proof below)3.	Feels more like a beta4.	Has barley any guns or vehicles5.	Specialist challenges are just unreasonable6.	No specific classes, so everyone can just run whatever they want, it doesn’t feel right and it’s annoying because every has lock on rockets now, not just engineers7.	Horribly optimised, there are some fixes, and I am now at 200+ fps, but  THESE DON'T WORK FOR EVERYONE , some 3090 systems are struggling to get 100 fps. (Fix will be attached down the bottom with other vids) 8.	It’s currently a buggy mess, like any EA game in the early stages9.	It doesn’t have a 2.4 user review out of 10 because it’s currently good10.	No scoreboards (Someone on reddit made a fully working one for 2042 like the old games in 3 hours... That's pathetic Dice, may as well be Skyrim at this point and let the community make your game better...11.	No classes12.	No destruction13.	No servers14.	No stats (Proper ones like the old games)15.	No all chat16.	Connection errors (lots) this will be even worse at main launch17.         I think cars and hovercrafts are too strong, it's 3 C4 or known as (C5) in this game to destroy one18.         Character customization is so bad, such a missed opportunity, the AI looks so much cooler than the snowflake characters 19.         Pretty much every under barrel attachment does the SAME thing, (4 of them have the same stats)It tries to be a mix of Warzone, Fortnite, R6 Siege, Apex and so on, and it’s kind of failed. This is an unfinished, unpolished and broken game as of now.There are bugs all over the place, glitching through the ground, airborne tanks, crab walking infantry, and ground sniffing soldiers moving at breakneck speed. (I’ll attach the glitching through walls vid too, it’s not even good like cod because you can’t even shoot people)I'm a little taken aback by how awful this game is. There is no scoreboard, only four firearms per class, mediocre specialists who take away the sense of true customisation, terrible servers, unreliable controls, the inability to resuscitate friends for no apparent reason. This game was far from ready for release.The sound is horrible, and you can't tell where someone is approaching.I actually think this will be a really good game, eventually. But for now, steer clear if you want my completely honest opinion…Another classic example of greedy corporate people pushing out a half-baked game to meet their $$$ quota, that know nothing about the game, I actually feel sorry for the developers. No developer would in their right mind would release this, they must have tested it I mean come on.Do not buy this until everything is fixed! P.S The portal mode is fun though!

																I spent $109.99 and didn't refund to save you wasting your money.The good:- Portal might be good some day.The bad:- No classes- Wide open maps with no cover- Maps are too big and turns the game into a running simulator- No scoreboard- No changing squads- No changing teams- Awful hit registration- Awful random bullet deviation- Broken hover tank that can scale walls and harder to blow up than a tank.- Bug that won't allow you to re-deploy when you die. You have to leave the game.- Bug that will show your team mates as enemies and they can knife you to death- Only 22 weapons, of which 2 are actually good.- Attachments unlocked that are cosmetic only.- Some attachments do the opposite of what the description gives.- XP disabled in custom portal games- Attachment progression disabled in AoW Solo / Squad matches.- Crashes and disconnects- Persistence data error that makes the game unplayable.- Only two modes on 7 maps for AoW that feels like you are playing wide open fields.- Control points in breakthrough mode on top of skyscrapers what can't be captured because there are 11 vehicles on top.- Hit registration, or lack there of. You will dump an entire clip into an enemies back to have them turn around and kill you.- You can get in a vehicle and shoot and kill yourself because the animation still has you outside of the vehicle.- Crap FPS on the highest end systems. Changing the settings makes virtually no difference.- No stats page- No server browser- Lobby disbands after every game, no carryover- No distinctions between factions except the glow stick colors. Soldiers around the world wear glow sticks to make themselves unseen to the enemy. Sometimes you see the Betty White specialist kill the other Betty White specialist who is then revived by the Betty White specialist.- When you spawn in you are forced into an animation of chambering a round that you can't avoid. If you spawn near an enemy, you are dead.- Not nearly enough destruction.- Can't change the scale of the UI, or the zoom of the minimap.- No all chat- No bullet damage on hit, this goes for vehicle hits too.- Finding yourself on the map or the mini-map can be... challenging.- You can't dive under water but...- You can fall through the map- Portal- No single player campaign that was left out to focus on the multiplayer.- No spectator mode- No community servers- No test range- No 3d spotting- No contextual leaning- No crouch sprinting- No scope zeroing- No tiered or paused reloads- No melee weapon choices- No thermal optics in the future- No Claymores- No first person takedowns which are different based on positioning.- No naval vehicles- No gunner direction indicator- No TV missles- No vehicle kill assists. Do 95% of the damage... Well, too bad.- No in-game VOIP at launch- No static weapon emplacements- No infantry focus maps. You will get farmed by vehicles.- UI is...well...interesting- Impossible to play with more than 3 friends.There is more, but I'm tired of typing. Take it for what you will.",Not Recommended

																- No single-player mode- No server browser- No general, team, or player scoreboard, only your own squad is shown. - No general chat, only team, squad, and party- No VOIP- No TDM/FFA- No leaning/peeking out while in cover- No score bonuses for headshots, multikills, or hit-based damage XP gain - No persistent lobbies (back to the main menu after every match)- No ammo pickups off dead enemies/players' kits, only obtained through specialists- No levolution beyond the tornado, the sandstorm on the Hourglass map only hurts visibility - No melee weapon options, though melee is completely discouraged by the bugs and low damage it yields- No spawning in other players' passenger seats when game is about to start - No changing teams, squads, or creating a new squad entirely. Squad bonuses, field upgrades, and drop-ins have also been removed - No self promoting to squad leader by requesting an order- No battle log/player stats page- Laughable end-of-match player highlights with voice lines that make these battle-hardened soldiers fighting a global-scale proxy war act like middle schoolers- Though the soundtrack is just as eclectic and electronic as past ""modern"" Battlefields, its placement is few and far between and is awkwardly sequenced throughout the match  - HUD is an absolute mess of small icons with large lettering, when an objective is capped a message takes up all of your top-screen real-estate for a good 5 seconds- Geforce 10 series card owners, even the later released ones, good luck in even attempting to come close to a stable frame rate, as this game is far from optimized and server-end latency is common - Weapon bloom (randomized spreading of shots) only helps bad players and hurts good ones - Buildings are not as destructible as previous Battlefield games, rarely will you ever see a collapsed building or create tactical cover through destroying chunks of walls or terrain- Crouch sprinting, being prone while on your back, and being knocked down from explosions from Battlefield V have been removed - Reworked class system into hero shooter-like character select- Can never gauge what height you can and can't climb over- Customization has nowhere near the depth of Battlefield 4, 1, and V - Only 19 primary weapons and 3 sidearms-- 4 assault rifles, 4 SMGs, 2 LMGs, 6 rifles, and 3 shotguns- Shotguns are completely unnecessary as close-quarters combat is never emphasized - 14 different vehicle types to make up for the maps' large sizes, though you are at the whim of availability and demand, so traversing the maps a majority of the time involves walking great distances for small rewards- Tarkov-like ""Hazard Zone"" mode where matchmaking lasts 3+ minutes and crossplay is all but required due to PC's player base",Not Recommended

																First up. Been part of the Battlefield community since BF2, BF2142, BF3, BF4 & BFV. I've watched this franchise grow and fell hard during BFV but then made it up for the issues by giving their all through the Pacific Storm update... before getting sent to the firing line for the development of BF2042.A let down for me. I don't know what to feel when i play this game. I know its Battlefield, but it feels ""off"". Movement feels COD-ish, like its snappy and fast, in an odd way. Its not as smooth as it was in BFV. Hell, BFV actually polished up movements and it felt realistic for me, its immersive.Performance is terrible. I'm getting inconsistent fps of 45-55. Especially on the main gamemode of 2042: All-Out-Warfare. Rubberbanding, gpu bottleneck, a lot of issues really. The update that they released helped a lot for many, but not on my end. BF Portal runs better and is a lot more fun.There's a lot of polished up features were removed that made Battlefield; Battlefield. I don't wanna list it out because you guys can just find it on the net. Audio mixing is... bad? it's too quiet. It doesn't pump my blood out like how the older titles did. I can go on and on and on but thats for another day. To you lot who've been with BF for a long time. 2042 is a no-go. There's so much features removed thats been polished up by BF1 and BFV that it makes 2042 feel off. An identity crisis? Apex-COD-Battlefield i dont know.To those of you who is pretty new to the franchise? Just hop onto BF4, BF1 and BFV. I can guarantee you that you'll save money AND have muuuch more fun than what 2042 is offering at the moment.As for me? I'll keep this game in my library. I'll see through this game for u bois. Im taking a shot for yall. Damn, this review is all over the place. Just like 2042's entire core gameplay. Adios",Not Recommended

																First of all i would like to thank my great friend Samuel Seal for gifting me this great game. Secondly, i would like to warn anyone that has a wife and kids that they will end up hating you as your love for Juve Stabia or other lowly obscure teams grows into an obsession fuelled by Just Eat and Deliveroo. You will experience lack of sleep and delusional thoughts of teams such as the mighty Aldershot Town finally lifting that Papa Johns trophy and you will extensively scout worldly 16 year olds from nations like Uruguay and Peru to then add a face pack and find out they look like the love child of Elmer Thudd and Rodney Trotter. Seriously though this is the best FM for years, the data hub is a good addition and the match engine is smooth, although there are some things that need addressing at some point, like the ridiculous headers for instance. I've played these games since the real early days before FM when all the boys were pals and did Champ Manager, on floppy disc hahaha (who remembers Champ Manager italia??) and they never get old for me.

																Was really tossing up buying the game as didn't have any particular saves planned. Have 1000+ hours on FM21 (and similar numbers for FM18/20) and thought that the game didn't look different enough from the previews. I was shocked when I played the game and noticed so many new features/UI updates. The data analysis update makes the analytics easier to understand and provides more precise information on how you your players/team follows your tactics, its even really fun just going through in depth and finding hidden details. In terms of gameplay, I don't have a great understanding of the engine, but my first reactions are it looks more and more like your team is actually playing football and its not just the same 8 or so different highlight packages that FM can often feel like. The Centre Backs is where I've noticed the greatest difference, not just with the new Wide Centre Back role (which is a lot of fun to mess around with) but even with Ball Playing Defenders actually making runs forward like you'd see in a real game and not just mulling round on the ball before launching a long ball into space. Finally if you like doing the small stuff like attending press conferences and team talks, the dialogue feels a lot more randomized/unique this year (so far). Overall, if you love FM, 22 provides so much more than just a roster update, and you're bound to notice the subtle changes in details that make all the difference.",Recommended

This isn't about the price as the IGE is still quite cheap, but nothing new has been added to it, nothing has changed from the last decade, so why that much of a price jump .. imagine next years release, and the full game costs £72, would we be happy with that? maybe i woke up on wrong side on bed today but this has annoyed me hahaha",Recommended

																Best Forza Horizon game to date, especially with the improvements to the graphics and vehicle sounds. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Editing this review for a ton more information, hope it's not overwhelming:--PROS:`Looks incredible when everything loads correctly (see below).`Vehicle sounds are a huge step in the right direction, especially with vehicle upgrades changing things even more to make each car sound unique.`Extremely fun, whether it be cruising around the map looking for XP boards or racing along the coast.`The map is pretty big and all the different areas make exploring incredibly fun.`Lots of things to do, I won't be getting bored of this game any time soon.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CONS:`The graphics have a few bugs, such as some pop-in and some clay-looking textures.`The online play has been rough, but they recently fixed a bug where constant disconnects would happen; just wish there was a better system to get together with friends in free-roam.`Horizon Arcade (formerly Forzathon Live) sucks right now. It is very hard to find people to complete the events, and when you do, some of the requirements for said events are extremely hard.`A few models for the cars are dated (S15 for example).`Some accolades require playing eliminator (Not really a con, I just hate battle royale modes :D)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Final conclusion: The pros outweigh the cons significantly; this is pretty much the best open-world racing game you can play to date. I've been pretty addicted to this game and have had a blast so far. If some of the cons I listed above get changed/fixed, I can see this game being an easy 10/10, but for now, I give it a 9.",Recommended

																I have been waiting for this moment. After playing for 150 hours and having completed all acts on Recruit, Veteran and Nightmare difficulties, I can finally write a quality review.First I would like to state that the game is good. But there's a lot of things that always make me sick while playing it. And that's why I'm giving this game a thumbs down. I enjoy playing this game but there's always something that causes me to go into a deep state of annoyance, hence I cannot recommend this game. I want to feel happy when I play videogames, I don't feel happy when I play this game, at all.-Difficulty scaling. As we all know (well, the people who play this game), difficulty scaling is so badly designed in this game. Recruit is too easy and Veteran-Nightmare are too hard. No matter what you say, this is a fact. And you can’t argue against facts and statistics. A very low percentage of players have completed this game on Veteran/Nightmare judging from the achievement statistics. I have no clue what the devs were thinking when they were implementing these difficulties. The “Corruption cards” and absolutely disgusting special ridden spawn rate makes it even worse.-The meta. As some of you know there's already a meta in this game. What is it you may ask? Speed decks. People use speed decks to complete the absolute abomination of a difficulty like Nightmare. The difficulty is so unbalanced and random ( a lot of RNG elements like “Corruption cards” or 5 “Tallboys” spawning in your face ), that it is close to impossible to complete it without speed decks. You need a lot of luck as well. This kinda takes away the whole point of the game - slaying zombies. But playing without speed decks on Nightmare mode will just make your day worse and not worth your time since it's absurdly broken.-RNG. This game is heavily dependent on RNG (especially in Veteran and Nightmare). I have never, ever played a zombie game that was so RNG based. “Corruption cards” are your worst enemies and can cost you a lot of wasted time and resets. It just feels so wrong when a Breaker spawns in the worst possible time + if you have acid zombies + running zombies + armored Stingers/Hockers + Tallboy hordes (HAHA) + all the other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Or you die just because a Hocker snipes you and as you may know, it's often not possible to dodge their aimbot spit or 5 Tallboys spawn in your face. And that's why we come to the next point:-Special Ridden and Spawn Rate. This game's special ridden spawn rate is absolutely disgusting. Multiple specials can spawn in your face and you can't do anything about it but die. Or survive but get a ♥♥♥♥ ton of trauma and not want to continue the campaign at that point because it’s useless and a waste of time.-Tallboy and Crusher grab range. These guys can still hit/grab you when you are 10 miles away.-Lagging ridden/bad servers. Every time I play this game I experience some kind of weird ridden-teleporting-lag. And that's not just me, everyone who I play with experiences the same thing. Apparently, if you go too fast, ridden fail to load in to the map properly and they start stuttering. Looks terrible and they literally can teleport on top of you and kill you.-Friend invite and friend list system. Okay, this is a very small thing but still is very annoying. If you want to invite someone you have to add them as a friend to do so. I find that very inconvenient. Also, your in-game friend list is not sorted in alphabetical order (seriously, devs?).-Stats do not properly display. Example: “ZWAT” skin. To get the “ZWAT” skin for each character you need to complete all acts on Nightmare with that particular character. You cannot see anywhere which acts have you done and which acts you are missing.-Ultimate Edition. The ultimate edition is honestly such a big waste of money. You get some cheap, totally unoriginal weapon skins (green camo - seriously, devs?) and some character skins that look almost the same as the original skins. I am shocked about the fact how unoriginal the devs are.-Glitches/exploits. There are some game breaking exploits in this game that have been around since the game first released as early access. Examples: card duplication, infinite copper, map skips.-No ""kick player"" button for the lobby host. Again, seriously devs? I just can't comprehend anymore.-Server regions. I am from Europe and if I am the host, the game should always put me in European servers. If I play with 1 American, it puts us in an American server even if I'm the host. Same thing goes with Singapore... like.. I am completely done at this point.-Checkpoint system. You play Nightmare. You get to the last mission and fail on that particular mission both times, running out of continues. You have to restart from the very first mission just because you failed on the last one and you can't even practise the last mission more in order to gain more knowledge and possibly think of new strats. You have to start from the VERY BEGINNING.  If you play without speed decks, you're going to be completely washed up after this.-Bad progression system. It's 2021 and they failed to implement a somewhat decent leveling/prestige system. After 100 hours you can pretty much get every single cosmetic item in this game and after that there's nothing really to grind for, except the ""ZWAT"" outfits maybe.-No true fullscreen mode setting in the in-game settings. You need to edit a .ini file to make your game go into true fullscreen. I don’t understand the reason behind this.This game can be amazing, but it needs some heavy polishing.",Not Recommended

																Now I like this game. Feels like left 4 dead but modern and fresh. The only reason I’m not recommending it is because you are basically penalized for playing solo campaign. You do not earn any currency or progression by playing solo and I don’t agree with that. Not everyone wants to play a game like this with people and progression towards currency and achievements, etc. should not be locked for doing so.",Not Recommended

																I wish I could give this game a mixed option. I love co-op games so much in the classic Left 4 Dead style, and I do enjoy this game. The gun play is a lot of fun and there's a lot more weapons to choose from than in classic titles.But here's the problem; I play solo on almost everything. I suffer from adulthood, so when I'm done with work for the day, I don't want to spend two hours trying to find teammates that are more invested in the game than racial slurs. The bots in this game are GOD AWFUL. In Easy difficulty, you can plow through the first half of the game, but the second half starts to get sticky with the AI. The first half on Medium difficulty is a good challenge, but the second half is practically unbeatable. The bots are constantly walking directly into your line of fire, getting stuck on everything, they don't heal when you ever actually need it, and good luck playing with any melee builds.Also, you're not allowed to unlock anything when you play solo. Cards, cosmetics, achievements, etc.Why are the devs punishing players for playing alone? Not everybody has groups of friends available to play games, especially by the time you're actually old enough to buy this game.Another aspect that irked me was how uninteresting the level design is. None of these maps are very memorable. Many levels start in the same ""hub world"" area with little variety as you progress towards the ""fresh"" maps. There were a couple of maps that were pretty cool, but for the most part, it's all pretty copy/paste, especially when you compare it to the contrast of classic titles.If they fix the AI and the solo progression, I'll gladly update this, but for now I'd wait for a sale. Especially if you play alone.",Not Recommended

Warning #1: Do not expect this to be Left 4 Dead 3. If you expect this, you are setting yourself up for some disappointment. It also restricts progression if you play it solo.Warning #2: You are paying $60 for the current version of the game. Turtle Rock has promised that microtransactions will be ""cosmetic only"" -- they neglect to clearly clarify that they don't consider DLC campaigns to be microtransactions. You will have to pay more for new campaigns in the future, unless you play with someone who has bought them -- in which case, you'll be forced to download and store GB's of data you cannot even use when playing solo.Warning #3: All your in-game voice chat is recorded for moderation. If this bothers you, please refrain from using it entirely. The game will provide an early warning.Warning #4: It is heresy for any self-proclaimed ""Left 4 Dead spiritual successor"" to be as anti-modding as Back 4 Blood is. I respect that Turtle Rock Studios just wanted to create a great game -- and they've succeeded -- but not without Phil Robb and Chris Ashton betraying their roots. Left 4 Dead and Valve cultivated a vibrant community of modders many of whom now work in the industry -- whereas Back 4 Blood stifles cultivation.Warner Bros' aggressive anti-modding terms are a regression, not a progression.That being said, on its own it's a solid game with countless great qualities:+ Beautiful art direction, from environments to characters, and lighting+ The user interface design is alarmingly smooth and clean, extensive color blind options+ Map clipping seems unobtrusive and parkour, you will have fun running around+ The guns are great, and being able to use them all in Fort Hope right away is also cool+ Fort Hope's boxing area and jukebox are great details, but would benefit from more places of utility in future updatesThere's clearly a lot of well-meaning love that went into this game, even if questionable decisions were made. It's now just a matter of the community keeping future decisions in check -- since we won't be able to do any of that ourselves with mods.For mods, look up Chet Faliszek's ""Anacrusis"" Discord server -- those are the other ex-L4D devs who actually care.",Recommended

Back 4 Blood,"Posted: 12 October
																After about 50 hours in the open beta and 40 in the final release, I feel comfortable saying it's a pretty good game.Jokes aside, there are some valid criticisms to be made. The easiest difficulty is incredibly easy, and the next is significantly harder. This difficulty curve really feels like it punishes individual players who don't have a group of friends to play with. It's a very team-oriented game, and to call playing with randoms oonline""hit or miss"" is being generous.On the topic of the team gameplay, the recruit difficulty does very little to prepare you for just how team-oriented the game is. If you play this like you would play Left 4 Dead, where all the characters are interchangeable and you don't need to worry too much about weapon types or skills each player uses, you can beat recruit fairly easily, but you will never beat the other modes. However, since many people will begin on recruit and see these strategies work, it won't be apparent just how important player specialisation is. It can give players who start there a false sense of how they should play the game and set them up for frustration later.Finally, one of my biggest complaints is the continue system. It is unnecessarily punishing without contributing virtually anything to the fun of the game. I can recognise that some players may value the challenge, but forcing us to replay multiple levels because of some bad RNG feels like bad design, especially on recruit & veteran. I would disable it if I could, and hope that a future patch will make this an option.Besides these points, however, I find the game incredibly fun with a high degree of replayability. There are definitely some things I could suggest to improve it, but, overall, I think it's a very solid experience. Advice for new players:- Start on recruit. Some people will say it's bad, too easy, or less fun, but in the later acts it can still be a challenge. Plus it's a great way to unlock some cards before trying the harder difficulty.- Decks matter, and the order of the decks matter. You draw the cards in order every time, so space them out accordingly. You can see ahead of time what missions you'll have and, assuming 1 card per mission, you can tell when you'll draw a certain card. Use this to your advantage to get the cards you need right when you need them.- Team specialisation is incredibly important. I don't just mean a bit of difference; I mean complete separation of roles. There are 4 types of weapon, and your team should have one of each. Whichever you are using, go all-in. A jack-of-all-trades build sounds good on paper, but you will pay for it in harder difficulties. - Play to your team's strengths. There are already a lot of people claiming expertise or saying there is a certain way you have to play, but that's entirely wrong. You can customise to your heart's content, and just because something works for them doesn't mean it will work for you. Using their strats or decks can be a good starting point, and may even work well, but you should not believe anyone presenting them as the ""best"" or the only ""correct"" build. Tweak it until it works for *you.*Most importantly though:- Have fun. It's just a game. Don't grind too hard or take it too seriously. The progression is the point, and having fewer things unlocked just gives you things to look forward to. You aren't worse for it, and everyone's been where you are, so don't stress and enjoy the game.",Recommended

								hmmmm. So I've spent 16 hours in the game, give or take, read the manual for it, and I've done enough content to comment on this a bit from a huge survival genre fan standpoint, but also can comment from a more technical standpoint as i've worked in the game development field as well.This game is pretty good. that is your TL:DR of it. If you enter this to compare it to conan exiles, RUST, mount and blade, conquerors blade, ARK, Life Is Feudal, etc. then you are already setting yourself up for disappointment.This game is very early access. Yes, it has a huge amount of content, sandbox building, skill trees, in depth grouping, guilds, city government type stuff, and other really unique features I was surprised to see. But some of the more core game mechanics need polishing. The combat is very rough around the edges as they focus on 2 different combat styles. This is coming from someone using their classic combat mode, I will be switching next time im on the other combat mode.Also, everyone is really early level. My current official server, the top is lv 28 before penalties, And i've been putting a lot of time into the game as well, but I am no where near top level or high level crafting. I don't even know where to get Iron yet.The PVP i cannot even comment on because I am on an official server which is PVE currently, but you can take your character to other servers (Counties).Translation needs work, combat needs work, some animations need work, the building system needs a few adjustments but it works.Again, its not a terrible game, It is pretty, its fun if you are into these sorts of games, and I cannot wait to start getting into diplomacy, seeing how transactions and trades work out, see a huge siege battle or huge armies marching by.Again, if you come into this game comparing it to others, you will start off having a bad time. Every game everyone is comparing this too all started in this state and crawled out of their bad reviews slowly. Giant survival games like this take a lot of polishing before they end up great. Some dont even make it to the great part.The state of this game and early access, and if you like survival type games? I can recommend. It is constantly being updated, bugs are getting squished, you can tell by the systems in place that the developers like what they are working on, its a good game. Will it get better? in time of course. They seem to be listening to the playerbase / early access buyers, so yeah, I can recommend. Needs work though, but its playable and enjoyable. Also, go start in the riverlands or the mountains, its beautiful out there.I would ignore the low hour count reviews. Not disregarding their opinion, but the game does not really open up till around lv 20. A lot of today's pc gamer's demand a lot of instant satisfaction and do not realize this is a slow burn game like ARK or conan. It takes time to get to where you need to be, but each tier is rewarding and does not feel grindy.....yet. time will tell though.current state? 7/10Its not bad, but needs work.",Recommended

								The game is very solid, it does not seem to be in an alpha phase, the contents are many, the perk and skill system is extremely deep and articulated, but not punitive. It recalls many dynamics seen in other games but presents them in an improved and more complete way. It adds many of the missing features we would have liked to see in other mmo survivors. The setting is ancient China, simply gorgeous. I recommend it, they came up with a largely complete game and not like other alpha games with very little content.

								The crafting is deep and interesting, gathering resources is a large part of the gameplay but my gripe is with the unnaccessabilty to casual players. Discord or the like is neccessary unless your good with an ok graphic lone farming sim. I joined a guild, because you cant get to a pvp server to battle until GUILD LEVEL 2 so I gathered all my belongings and made a long journey during which my horse died and had to abandon precious materials Id spent hours gathering, because of weight. I got there, my new home allies surrounded me and were following me and messaging me ... lol So long story short they tricked me, killed me took everything and kicked me out of the guild so i didnt have access to my belongings. 8 hours in(as a dad thats like a week) And c oc k su c ke r allies took it in 5 minutes. Combat stinks compared to bannerlord or even common rps. You are so weak at (8 hr lvl18) you cant kill a boar with spear + shield + Armour. PVP combat blows because of janky nature. Weapon scale is Anime-ish. Asain Culture Only. positives- crafting is dope though also hard to use in comparison                 skills are really cool although you are far to weak in the beginning, like a kitten                  concept is good",Not Recommended

Early Access Review
My experience with MoE so far is based off 7 hours playing casually on a PvE server to learn the game.While it has progression via quests and side quests a lot of the game is left unexplained, being so new game guides and wiki are sparse and many of your questions about the game cannot be found even on their official discord. An example would be your quests lead you to create a personal claim, that claim is protected from decay via a personal claim banner that has a 2 day timer. When you hover over it, it has text saying you have paid for protection, interact with it and it gives you a method of selling items for currency to the lord or the land. You would assume (based on games like Rust with their resource cabinets) this was a way of increasing your protection window but that isn't the case. Essentially you have to destroy and replace the personal claim flag to reset the personal timer, which isn't stated anywhere. Oh and when it comes to guild claims, you CAN reset the timer without replacing, which leads to confusion.Server Selection is... weird. I assume you start by selecting a Global Hub, Then a regional server hub (EU/NA/Asia) and finally a game region. Thankfully when you rejoin the game there is a ""quick join"" option but I hope friends can join me via steam friends as I have no idea how to find out exactly what/where I am located. I know that each server is 80 players and you can transfer from one server to another via ingame currency but I've yet to find the NPC to allow me to do so.Graphics are decent, The game puts my poor RX 580 to 99% utilisation however hidden under the nice grass and foliage most of the actually ground surface lacks detail like you would find in games like Conan Exiles. Its a game that looks nice with full graphics but looks like a game from 2002 if you strip away the foliage.Combat Mechanics are clunky. You have two modes ""MoE"" and ""Classic"". The only difference I could see is MoE's own mode blocks while you hold the attack key down and you move your mouse to the direction you want to attack from, while Classic Mode enables right click block. I need to input here that you right click block with off-hand when one is equipped so I'd recommend using MoE mode. At any rate, this game is not a fast paced twitch shooter, more like a combat simulator in which player tactics and positioning will be key over player skill and reaction time. It play like Last Oasis but much slower and without grappling, nor is it as fluid as games like Conan Exiles.Crafting is good, its slightly too resource intensive early game, talking 1000's of grass turned into rope and 100's of trees for a basic 2x2 house and armour. I've not even gotten to the smelting stage yet, although I have gathered copper ready for it. Your early game is wood, bone then hide/fabric. The Crafting progression is nice, earn points with actions and use points to unlock a progression tree split into 4 or 5 different tabs.Nobility system is still early days for me, I've ranked up once which gave me 2.5% more HP. From what I've seen thus far you can become a lord of the land and such, have peons to work for you like Thralls in Conan Exiles but I've not gotten that far. I did find recruits, who when you walk upto them and press E they list the various stuff they want as payment for you to hire them, thinks like raw meat and armour.Levelling seems to happen as you play, gathering, crafting and completing quests. There are even daily quests and such but at this time levelling up is a secondary while I construct a base and progress through crafting. You level quite quickly just by progressing through the main quest line.Why do I recommend?This game starts with your run of the mill sandbox survival game core and adds questing, governance and server transfers. If your like me and you own practically every game under the survival sandbox genre, there is a lot here that is unique to the title to justify the box price. As for the games longevity only time will tell. If the studio behind this title keep building on the foundation they have here this game could become very popular like Rust or Conan. If however they keep it as is, you will get your hours worth out of it with the content available as of right now. I would say though, the game while not in an alpha state is still rough around the edges in certain areas, if you can live with that then go for it.",Recommended

								Decent game.  If you are looking for a PVP MMO with a great combat system then its not for you.  Combat is definitely the down side.  needs to be overhauled to a more action style combat and increase the speeds (running, attacking, etc)But if you are like me and you play survival games to build a masterpiece fort/base or even a city, this game will be worth the purchase.  so far 6.5/10, with updates i can see this being a great game.I see reviews about people ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ about repetitive game play after only an hour played (one was only 20 minutes) then go on to say play Conan, laughable since it is the same style. I love Conan it is one of my favorites but Conan is super repetitive too. i would spend the first hour everyday harvesting for my fort, before even equipping a weapon, same style in this game. It is unfortunate that people expect to have everything asap in the first hour of game play, sad really how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gamers have become.",Recommended

Later I found out it was a false positive ban and was Razer Synapse that caused it. Went to go appeal for a ban but thats never going to happen. So i basically got $110 stolen from me thanks EA ♥♥♥♥ you",Not Recommended

																This game is meant to sell, not play. They invested all of their efforts into things like pointless weather effects and completely unnecessary scale so they could use them as selling points instead of investing in gameplay. And because of that ridiculous scale, they decided to throw in as many vehicle as possible without thinking of balancing them, Again to use the spectacle as a selling point.They swapped classes, a battlefield staple, for specialists because they would be easier to monetize. They got rid of so many great details and gameplay additions from old battlefields, so they could focus on making the game more sellable, not playable.They practically got rid of all sense of community by getting rid of voip, scoreboards, clans, and all chat.And not to mention how absolutely horrible the performance is. I am fortunate enough to have a pretty solid pc, (10900k, 3080) i get constant stutters ranging from 50 to 90 fps on settings meant for performance. I cant imagine how they expect people who have been getting screwed over by scalpers from getting components to play this game.The ONLY redeemable thing about this game is portal. It offers a great nostalgia trip and has a lot of potential. Unfortunately since people went straight to abusing it which i have no clue how dice didn't see that coming, its basically impossible to level up with right now.I could honestly go on but i think the part that is the most disappointing thing about all of this is that this game was labeled as ""a love letter to fans"" before it was even revealed, yet here they are ignoring feedback on what fans want.",Not Recommended

 Battlefield 2042 Review Firstly, personally I think It's sad people defend this game. I WANT this game to be good, very badly, I did spend $140 AUD for the ultimate edition since the beta felt really good, better than this main release somehow. So I've been here playing the base game for a while, and now you don't have to spend any money. I played 30 hours so YOU don't have to. Firstly I don't care about $140, to the people in the comments, you manage your money and I'll manage mine, you're not my accountant. Based on the 3000 + helpful votes I've stopped over 100+ people spending money on this game so It's 100% worth it, I've made EA and Dice lose more money I than I've given them (Not that they'd care), use common sense before you comment. Will also attach some videos down the bottom to show / prove what I talk about in this review.This game has much potential, but in its current state it’s frustrating, badly optimised and doesn’t function as it should. Most of the time when I'm shooting I feel like a stormtrooper. I often find this game being more annoying than exciting with the current build and bugs. This should not have been released yet in my honest opinion, I'll elaborate further after the pros and cons and attach short video proof of the issues I am experiencing.Pros:1.	Has great potential2.	Gun play feels ""okay""3.	Has a decently classic battlefield feel4.	Funny ♥♥♥♥ happens here and there, as it should with battlefield5.     You can do cool stuff like the previous games (For example wingsuit, cancel it mid-air, pull out a launcher and blast someone, then continue to wingsuit again I'll attach a video down the bottom of what I mean)Cons:1.	Bloom, the bloom is horrible, just find out yourself if you dare. Bloom takes away any skill and makes fights come down to luck which is just horrible for anyone who is half decent at aiming.2.	Hit registration doesn’t work (Proof below)3.	Feels more like a beta4.	Has barley any guns or vehicles5.	Specialist challenges are just unreasonable6.	No specific classes, so everyone can just run whatever they want, it doesn’t feel right and it’s annoying because every has lock on rockets now, not just engineers7.	Horribly optimised, there are some fixes, and I am now at 200+ fps, but  THESE DON'T WORK FOR EVERYONE , some 3090 systems are struggling to get 100 fps. (Fix will be attached down the bottom with other vids) 8.	It’s currently a buggy mess, like any EA game in the early stages9.	It doesn’t have a 2.4 user review out of 10 because it’s currently good10.	No scoreboards (Someone on reddit made a fully working one for 2042 like the old games in 3 hours... That's pathetic Dice, may as well be Skyrim at this point and let the community make your game better...11.	No classes12.	No destruction13.	No servers14.	No stats (Proper ones like the old games)15.	No all chat16.	Connection errors (lots) this will be even worse at main launch17.         I think cars and hovercrafts are too strong, it's 3 C4 or known as (C5) in this game to destroy one18.         Character customization is so bad, such a missed opportunity, the AI looks so much cooler than the snowflake characters 19.         Pretty much every under barrel attachment does the SAME thing, (4 of them have the same stats)It tries to be a mix of Warzone, Fortnite, R6 Siege, Apex and so on, and it’s kind of failed. This is an unfinished, unpolished and broken game as of now.There are bugs all over the place, glitching through the ground, airborne tanks, crab walking infantry, and ground sniffing soldiers moving at breakneck speed. (I’ll attach the glitching through walls vid too, it’s not even good like cod because you can’t even shoot people)I'm a little taken aback by how awful this game is. There is no scoreboard, only four firearms per class, mediocre specialists who take away the sense of true customisation, terrible servers, unreliable controls, the inability to resuscitate friends for no apparent reason. This game was far from ready for release.The sound is horrible, and you can't tell where someone is approaching.I actually think this will be a really good game, eventually. But for now, steer clear if you want my completely honest opinion…Another classic example of greedy corporate people pushing out a half-baked game to meet their $$$ quota, that know nothing about the game, I actually feel sorry for the developers. No developer would in their right mind would release this, they must have tested it I mean come on.Do not buy this until everything is fixed! P.S The portal mode is fun though! If your hits register  Vids I did a basic video review with some game play here: https://youtu.be/fB2emraNRzI Bloom and bad hit reg example: https://youtu.be/dWs8ly-PR4AFPS FIX (Worked for me): https://youtu.be/U721tEc-VSMThe wingsuit thing I mentioned in the Pros, like I said it has potential to be a fun battlefield game, it just isn't at the moment, there's way cooler clips than this out there: https://youtu.be/hbhMoTx3pK0How the AI looks cooler than us: https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield2042/comments/qvzbac/so_sad/Glitching through walls (Happens often with wingsuit): https://youtu.be/SDWwAflHQIM Feel free to agree or disagree with me in the comments, curious as to what you guys thought if you played the early access.Once the game is in working order, I'll mark this review positive and change the headingTo people in the comments personally attacking people over opinions and money, if you can't see anything wrong with that you may find a recourse to help you here: https://checkpointorg.com/global/",Not Recommended

																I spent $109.99 and didn't refund to save you wasting your money.The good:- Portal might be good some day.The bad:- No classes- Wide open maps with no cover- Maps are too big and turns the game into a running simulator- No scoreboard- No changing squads- No changing teams- Awful hit registration- Awful random bullet deviation- Broken hover tank that can scale walls and harder to blow up than a tank.- Bug that won't allow you to re-deploy when you die. You have to leave the game.- Bug that will show your team mates as enemies and they can knife you to death- Only 22 weapons, of which 2 are actually good.- Attachments unlocked that are cosmetic only.- Some attachments do the opposite of what the description gives.- XP disabled in custom portal games- Attachment progression disabled in AoW Solo / Squad matches.- Crashes and disconnects- Persistence data error that makes the game unplayable.- Only two modes on 7 maps for AoW that feels like you are playing wide open fields.- Control points in breakthrough mode on top of skyscrapers what can't be captured because there are 11 vehicles on top.- Hit registration, or lack there of. You will dump an entire clip into an enemies back to have them turn around and kill you.- You can get in a vehicle and shoot and kill yourself because the animation still has you outside of the vehicle.- Crap FPS on the highest end systems. Changing the settings makes virtually no difference.- No stats page- No server browser- Lobby disbands after every game, no carryover- No distinctions between factions except the glow stick colors. Soldiers around the world wear glow sticks to make themselves unseen to the enemy. Sometimes you see the Betty White specialist kill the other Betty White specialist who is then revived by the Betty White specialist.- When you spawn in you are forced into an animation of chambering a round that you can't avoid. If you spawn near an enemy, you are dead.- Not nearly enough destruction.- Can't change the scale of the UI, or the zoom of the minimap.- No all chat- No bullet damage on hit, this goes for vehicle hits too.- Finding yourself on the map or the mini-map can be... challenging.- You can't dive under water but...- You can fall through the map- Portal- No single player campaign that was left out to focus on the multiplayer.- No spectator mode- No community servers- No test range- No 3d spotting- No contextual leaning- No crouch sprinting- No scope zeroing- No tiered or paused reloads- No melee weapon choices- No thermal optics in the future- No Claymores- No first person takedowns which are different based on positioning.- No naval vehicles- No gunner direction indicator- No TV missles- No vehicle kill assists. Do 95% of the damage... Well, too bad.- No in-game VOIP at launch- No static weapon emplacements- No infantry focus maps. You will get farmed by vehicles.- UI is...well...interesting- Impossible to play with more than 3 friends.There is more, but I'm tired of typing. Take it for what you will.",Not Recommended

Squad bonuses, field upgrades, and drop-ins have also been removed - No self promoting to squad leader by requesting an order- No battle log/player stats page- Laughable end-of-match player highlights with voice lines that make these battle-hardened soldiers fighting a global-scale proxy war act like middle schoolers- Though the soundtrack is just as eclectic and electronic as past ""modern"" Battlefields, its placement is few and far between and is awkwardly sequenced throughout the match  - HUD is an absolute mess of small icons with large lettering, when an objective is capped a message takes up all of your top-screen real-estate for a good 5 seconds- Geforce 10 series card owners, even the later released ones, good luck in even attempting to come close to a stable frame rate, as this game is far from optimized and server-end latency is common - Weapon bloom (randomized spreading of shots) only helps bad players and hurts good ones - Buildings are not as destructible as previous Battlefield games, rarely will you ever see a collapsed building or create tactical cover through destroying chunks of walls or terrain- Crouch sprinting, being prone while on your back, and being knocked down from explosions from Battlefield V have been removed - Reworked class system into hero shooter-like character select- Can never gauge what height you can and can't climb over- Customization has nowhere near the depth of Battlefield 4, 1, and V - Only 19 primary weapons and 3 sidearms-- 4 assault rifles, 4 SMGs, 2 LMGs, 6 rifles, and 3 shotguns- Shotguns are completely unnecessary as close-quarters combat is never emphasized - 14 different vehicle types to make up for the maps' large sizes, though you are at the whim of availability and demand, so traversing the maps a majority of the time involves walking great distances for small rewards- Tarkov-like ""Hazard Zone"" mode where matchmaking lasts 3+ minutes and crossplay is all but required due to PC's player base",Not Recommended

																First up. Been part of the Battlefield community since BF2, BF2142, BF3, BF4 & BFV. I've watched this franchise grow and fell hard during BFV but then made it up for the issues by giving their all through the Pacific Storm update... before getting sent to the firing line for the development of BF2042.A let down for me. I don't know what to feel when i play this game. I know its Battlefield, but it feels ""off"". Movement feels COD-ish, like its snappy and fast, in an odd way. Its not as smooth as it was in BFV. Hell, BFV actually polished up movements and it felt realistic for me, its immersive.Performance is terrible. I'm getting inconsistent fps of 45-55. Especially on the main gamemode of 2042: All-Out-Warfare. Rubberbanding, gpu bottleneck, a lot of issues really. The update that they released helped a lot for many, but not on my end. BF Portal runs better and is a lot more fun.There's a lot of polished up features were removed that made Battlefield; Battlefield. I don't wanna list it out because you guys can just find it on the net. Audio mixing is... bad? it's too quiet. It doesn't pump my blood out like how the older titles did. I can go on and on and on but thats for another day. To you lot who've been with BF for a long time. 2042 is a no-go. There's so much features removed thats been polished up by BF1 and BFV that it makes 2042 feel off. An identity crisis? Apex-COD-Battlefield i dont know.To those of you who is pretty new to the franchise? Just hop onto BF4, BF1 and BFV. I can guarantee you that you'll save money AND have muuuch more fun than what 2042 is offering at the moment.As for me? I'll keep this game in my library. I'll see through this game for u bois. Im taking a shot for yall. Damn, this review is all over the place. Just like 2042's entire core gameplay. Adios",Not Recommended

																With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:This overall game is good. It doesn't always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it really shines.The gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.The game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with the DCV, this is considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (""Darkness Zones"" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). With that said, dungeons (currently only 'The Shattered Throne', 'Pit of Heresy', and 'Prophecy') and raids (""Last Wish"" from Forsaken, ""Garden of Salvation"" from Shadowkeep, and ""The Deep Stone Crypt"" from Beyond Light) are best experienced with a team, so don't shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. 'Tis only polite). Of the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I really enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it's fine I guess, but I've never liked PvP that's dependent, at least in part, on personal progression)Don't be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.Some stuff just won't be explained in game. It's not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.For anything that you can't easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (""What are random rolls? Which do I keep?"") that we'd be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. Now is a great time to be getting into Destiny 2. You absolutely won't regret it. Take all of the pettiness and negative reviews about the game going F2P, servers crashing for less than an hour after launch (c'mon guys), or whatever else has people triggered with a massive grain of salt. The fact that a representative chunk of this game is now free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet (unless you're crazy like me). Any other questions about this game as a product (""What is weapon sunsetting? Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?"") should absolutely be researched elsewhere. [Especially now that infusion caps AKA sunsetting have been announced as being effectively rolled back, which no longer makes older content irrelevant in newer endgame activities. They also announced that the level cap increase season after season will be reduced by a significant margin, cutting down on the seasonal grind considerably. Do your research before you buy older expansions, but once both of these changes are in the game, I can wholeheartedly recommend D2 again.]If you're looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. Remember, everyone is starting at the max light level from the most recent expansion, which is great for playing with veterans without too much grinding, but means that you can miss out on the ""learning the ropes"" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain.

Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPS's, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Shadowkeep's launch, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If I've missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and I'll do my best to update this periodically. [Updated again with the announced removal of sunsetting and lower seasonal power caps during Season 13, per https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50124]TL:DR: It's good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it's free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If you're overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.",Recommended

Was sorely disappointed about the lack of content and amount of things to do. I had a good time with it, but I ultimately wrote the game off as a loss and walked away. Laughed at the thought of a year 2 season pass after getting burned so hard the first time.2018: Pretty much forgot Destiny 2 existed.2019: Continued forgetting Destiny 2 existed until October 1st. Decided to give New Light a try because screw it why not. I'm completely overwhelmed with how much the game has grown and the sheer amount of things to do. The game did a full 180 from what it was last time I played it. Within a couple days of New Light I went ahead and bought Forsaken and Shadowkeep because I felt like Bungie finally earned my money. Looking forward to reaching the light cap again, min/maxing stats and going for perfect weapon rolls.I'm so glad Bungie chose Steam over Epic.

Terraria,"Posted: 5 May, 2020
																Terraria’s final major update, Journey’s End (1.4), is here. And it’s great! I’ll explain to all of you why I recommend Terraria. You should get this game right now since the final update dropped. I’ll try to update my Steam review some more (posted May 5, 2020; edited May 20, 2020; May 28, 2020; March 6, 2021; and August 7, 2021. Thanks for all the feedback! It's much appreciated).Intro:If I were to explain Terraria to someone quickly, I would put it like this: Terraria is a game that has a whole world to explore. You mine, build, craft, fish, and fight to progress through the game. You can focus on fighting enemies and improving your gear to fight various bosses, and/or you can focus on building your house and buildings and making things look pretty. Terraria has something for everyone. The combination of survival, fighting, exploration, and building aspects is satisfying (and I'm someone who usually plays shooter games). So I believe that you can find something in Terraria for you.Building:When Re-Logic added half blocks and slanted blocks to Terraria in 1.2, the building got so much more interesting and versatile. There are so many different types of blocks in this game with their own unique textures and styles, and with paint there are even more possibilities. Some of the creations made in this game are insanely good.Difficulty:Overall, Terraria on Classic (formerly known as Softcore) and Normal mode is not that hard, but just be aware that no matter what, you’ll probably die a lot as a beginner. If you like a challenge, however, Expert mode is the way to go (plus you get extra advantages, such as exclusive accessories, for having an increased difficulty). Even more difficult is Master mode, giving you even more loot than Expert mode. And if you want the game to be especially difficult, you could choose Mediumcore (drop all items on death), or Hardcore (permadeath) during character creation. There is also Journey mode, which is an adjustable difficulty semi-creative mode that requires a Journey exclusive character (can’t go to Normal, Expert, or Master mode worlds). Personally, I think Classic and Expert mode is the most fun way to play.Music:Terraria’s music is great. All of it fits with the style of the game. Almost every biome has a unique song to fit with the theme, and there are different songs for bosses and events as well. I bought the official soundtrack and I love to listen to it whenever I want some background music.Multiplayer:Multiplayer is incredibly easy to set up. The easiest way to play is to join/host through Steam. You can also enter an IP address, which, before 1.3, used to be the only way to play multiplayer at all, but now it's so much easier with Steam integration.Connection is rarely a problem for me, although I think I’ve found that the host has worse lag than the other players, when there is lag that is.Terraria is very fun to play with friends and even just with strangers. There are teaming options, PVP, and other multiplayer elements built into the game. Bosses are often much easier to beat in multiplayer as well, because usually if one player dies, the other player can continue to fight the boss and stay alive long enough to let the first player respawn.Performance:Terraria runs very well. On my custom PC, which is great for gaming, the game runs perfectly on max settings and has nearly instantaneous loading speeds. On my HP computer, which is not built for gaming, and on my 11-year-old Toshiba laptop, the game runs very nicely on low settings, with only minor loading times.There are several video settings that can be modified to help performance. I would recommend at least turning the background and effects off for lower-end computers.Price:Terraria is very inexpensive. It’s one of the few games I’ve bought at full price and found it completely worth it.Struggles:Terraria has a learning curve. There are many things left up to you to figure out from the start. The Guide NPC is there to give some help. Many things, however, are left up to the player to figure out, much of which is just learned through time and experience. I would recommend looking up tips, tricks, and other information online, such as on the Official Terraria Wiki, or watch videos, like those of ChippyGaming and Edward on YouTube. Personally, I enjoy the learning curve, and the struggle to learn new things is just the right amount to be enjoyable and not annoying.To get to the endgame of Terraria, it does take a while. There is so much content and so many bosses in just vanilla Terraria, that it can be overwhelming, and progression can sometimes feel slow. You may want to rush things like bosses, but you have to prepare well for bosses, or else you’ll probably die. I used to ragequit when I couldn’t beat bosses, and I still get frustrated if I can’t beat a boss. Once you defeat bosses, however, it feels so worth it. And you don’t have to follow an exactly linear path either. Also, you don’t have to play for 30+ hours for a full playthrough just to feel accomplished. From one to a million hours, this game is fun for any length of time.My biggest struggle with this game is the grind for certain items. Some items are extremely hard to get, due to low drop rates or pretty extreme circumstances. There are many, many items with a drop chance lower than 1%. Realistically, you won’t get every item in the game, if that’s what you’re aiming for. I once wanted to get every enemy banner in the game (you have to kill 50 of the same enemy to get a banner) legitimately, but I gave up on that idea because of how grindy it is to kill 50 of each enemy for the rarest ones (that darn Nymph Banner). To put it simply, it’s possible to get every item in the game, but it’s just not worth it. You should, however, build farms for certain items. But the point is, just get the items in the game that you really want to get legitimately, and it’ll be worth it (if you did want every single item in the game, you can use inventory editors or go to free item servers, but it’s not fun to abuse these).Tips:* Organize and name chests ASAP* Place rope down a Hellevator* Use Cursed/Ichor Torches (craftable in Hardmode) for Hellevators and bridges, since they’re liquidproof* Use the Hardy Saddle (Turtle Mount) with Brick Layer/Architect Gizmo Pack to place down blocks in a straight line at a constant speed, which is perfect for building bridges. Smart cursor is extremely useful for this as well, which is activated using Ctrl (default)* Look up how to maintain world purity, since the Corruption, Crimson, and the Hallow biomes spread across the world, and the Corruption/Crimson can destroy the Jungle biome over time and do other unfortunate things* Go fishing. It’s worth it. Fishing gives you so many tools, accessories, and other loot that enhance the game tremendously. Once you find the Angler NPC in the Ocean biome at either end of the world, use him to get quests to find a specific fish, which you can redeem for loot* Use Logic Sensors (Player Above) and Actuators for enemy/NPC-proof doors. Be careful about using actuators on blocks though, since it can occasionally reset the room status as suitable or reset your spawnpoint. As of 1.4, doors are much easier to deal with since they can auto open and close* For making potions, use an Alchemy Table from the Dungeon to have a 33% chance to not consume potion ingredients* Use Invisibility Potions while farming for Truffle Worms* Use Warmth Potions for the Frost MoonConclusion:I've played this game for 10 years now. I made a Steam account for this game, and I've played through so much of the game's development back when there wasn't even a fraction of the number of items in the game. To put it simply, Terraria is my favorite game. So after over a 1000 hours of playtime, I can safely say that I 100% recommend buying and playing Terraria.",Recommended

																I've never actually taken the time to write out a real review of a game, but this one absolutely deserves it.Terraria was my first ever game on PC and was the entire reason for me getting one. I had originally started playing the game on my Xbox 360, only to later beg my parents to buy me a computer so that I could play the 1.2 update. After that, I spent hours grinding through the game. It was shortly after my first time completing the game during 1.2 that I played the game again with friends. Though not a memorable experience in of itself, it did pave the way for those friendships to evolve further. Then we get to the release of the 1.3 update in the summer of 2015. I absolutely lost my sh*t for this update. For months my friends and I planned to play through the game again and spend time exploring all the new content. That was my first character that ever surpassed 100 hours of playtime. After that initial playthrough with my friends, I would periodically revisit the game on my own and with my friends for years. Sometimes there would be mods, sometimes it would be the original experience. Regardless of how I played, I never ever got bored with the game. I may only have 1600 hours across 6 years, but each one of those hours was spent in the game having a blast and completing my saves for each character I played on. With the Journeys end update coming out earlier this year, an update I have played through and through, I have finally managed to scrounge up the courage to say goodbye to this game. That doesn't mean that I'm going to stop playing it, that will never be a feasible option to me, especially with a game that has shaped my childhood. This review serves as a ode to an amazing game that has changed my life, as well as a way for me to cope with the game no longer receiving updates.I will forever thank the wonderful company of Re-Logic for an amazing product and the community that has surrounded the game for sharing such a novel game with me. Goodbye Re-Logic, and I look forward to future endeavors. Sincerely,Katie Dixon AKA KittoMen",Recommended

																Honestly, I don't know why Terraria has so many haters. This game literally has everything. Fun to play, tons of things to do, bosses to kill, ofc it has multiplayer so you can enjoy everything with friends, items to farm, a lot of stuff and decorations to build with, not to mention that if you hit the bottom and feel like you have completed the game, you can install some mods adding a crazy amount of new features, items, ect ...  When you're ingame (and I don't really know how to explain it) there's just something very chilling about it, maybe it's the music, maybe it's just every little detail about it. That's just how the game works. Perfect for chilling when you had a bad or exhausting day, but it's also the perfect entertainment for your free time. 10/10",Recommended

 You feel an evil presence watching you... This is the sort of game that you boot up thinking you'll spend an hour or two on, only to one day wake up face down on your keyboard surrounded by bottles and plates wondering where the past 3 weeks went. 100 hours in and I've still not defeated the current 'final' boss, something that's a mixture of the games' excellent difficulty curve, and a melancholy realisation that once I defeat him, my time with the game will naturally come to an end. Primarily, Terraria is a sandbox game. You appear in a new world with some basic equipment and no real instruction, eventually you will build a small house to survive the monsters that surface during the night, discover some form of corruption eating away at the world, encounter new NPCs and face off against powerful Boss enemies. Despite all this, you are given little direction, these are merely facets of a larger game that allows players to do as they wish, encountering all the world has to offer at mostly their own pace. Part of the great design behind the title is in the difficulty curve I mentioned earlier, meaning challenges pitted against a player start easy and steadily increase at a rate easy to handle. Although traditional RPG elements are largely absent, a discrete levelling system is present in the form of Bosses that have been defeated, meaning if you don't progress through these enemies then the gameplay doesn't become more difficult. In fact, the first boss doesn't spawn until you're suitably equipped with armour and health. My hours in the game are split roughly equally between single and multiplayer. Single player stands up on its own perfectly fine, but in my opinion the game is much more rewarding gathering some friends and working together to tackle the bosses, as the feeling of reaching new goals is shared, and the ammount of 'grinding' for materials is spread across multiple people. It also helps to appreciate the brilliant soundtrack, as if you voice chat with your group then spontaneous humming along loudly is to be expected. Enemy design is exciting and unique, with floating eyes, possessed suits of armour, giant robotic worms, and a ninja suspended in a giant ball of slime all making appearances. That being said, whoever on the design team is responsible for 'hellbats' has earned a special sort of hatred from myself...All in all Terraria is an amazing experience from beginning to end, its tone is humourous at times whist still provoking a feeling of wonderment and mystery in its exploration, and fearful excitement at its combat. It's a game I will come back to time and time again looking to recapture the memories I've made, and to forge new ones. It is a rare game in that with no shred of a doubt, these hours I have spent were not wasted. I heartily recommend that you purchase this game.  Fortune and glory kid...",Recommended

																So, here's a simplified list of what you'll find in Terraria: - This is a 2D RPG with platformer and sandbox elements- It has an incredible amount of content to it- Multiple classes that are shaped through armor bonuses (but you can use other items not of your class)- Idk like a billion items? Lots of weapons, armor, cosmetics, and building material. It's crazy- A good healthy serving of cool and interesting bosses to fight- Lots of NPC's to buy stuff from (be ready to build basically a hotel for the like 30 of them in the game now)- Really good retro soundtrack but more modern, that fit the creative environments they pair with. Boss fight music gets you pumped! - Is it too easy for you? Try Expert mode! Don't feel like you're penalized enough for dying? Set your character to Hardcore!- I almost forgot to mention… SO MUCH CRAFTINGCons? Hmm.- Inventory management… the abundance of items will overwhelm you. I usually make a structure dedicated to storing all my loot in chests. Stay organized!- Fishing is pretty useful but… well it’s not exactly exciting. You can get some great stuff that way though.- Expect a big difficulty spike after defeating the boss in the Underworld! You’ll feel like a noob all over again, but once you work past it is where the game feels like it truly begins for me.- Some items in the game are pretty rare and some of these rares are used to craft or otherwise obtain some of the best loot in the game. Other thought: - If you can play with friends, or find people to run through the game with, do it. It's much more fun that way. You can still enjoy it quite a bit single player, however... it's not the same when you can't laugh when someone gets destroyed by a boulder trap.Story time (if you want to torture yourself and read my rambling):I bought this game ages ago, back when it was still in development, before any of the expansions and cleanups it's gone through. I spent $10 on this.Since then, the Dev team (at least back in 2014-2015 or so when I kept up with it) would post threads about once a month at the least to let people know what was planned/ the progress of the game. It kept getting updated, adding more content and mechanics. I remember being super excited when new weapon types were added, rare mounts were added. Accessories so your character can fly around the map? Gimme. Something I always admire too is Re-Logic did not simply focus on adding more stuff end game, they kept polishing up early game too, adding things like Ropes to make things easier until you get hookshots, simple versions of weapons you find later like Spears, wooden yo-yo, more early game magic items. It used to be a much less enjoyable, slower grind to get to mid game content where the pace picks up.There were at least a couple times where the development with the game was supposedly going to halt, and I was satisfied with it then. I'd gotten more content and enjoyment out of Terraria than most games I'd bought for $30 or more. Yet somehow, maybe a year after hearing nothing, a new content update would surprisingly be pushed out. This happened at least twice, when I thought it would be laid to rest as is. I spent $10 on this.",Recommended

								Dev, please hire a team. This game is not allowed to perish under the physical limitations of a single human trying to work on it. Brilliant but needs aggressive expansion before it disappears from people's radars.PS: The review is positive, I love it. Kinda seen everything in it but, I enjoy it. Multiplayer games tend to have a short life span (Particularly Indie ones), directly related to the player base. If this goes one month without *Content* updates (which is very very very likely to happen) players will drop it, uninstall, and find a better MP game to stay on. It's a huge task to keep a MP game alive, but one can only hope.And for anyone in the comments, this might not be the best place to express concerns. There is a discord https://discord.gg/QxvWuqX which is very active. Also, I understand that they update the game for bugs and fixes on a daily basis, but I am referring to content because that is what keeps players engaged.Also, here is the Trello, for anyone who is interested in what is to come for this game.https://trello.com/b/9QrnqQ1j/phasmophobia##UpdateVoting for most innovative gameplay <3 good luck devs",Recommended

																I bought the $110 version of the game I played it for 2 days the went to go long on the 3rd day after finishing up a paper then im greeted by a message of you're banned I go to EAs website to find out I was apparently cheating. Later I found out it was a false positive ban and was Razer Synapse that caused it. Went to go appeal for a ban but thats never going to happen. So i basically got $110 stolen from me thanks EA ♥♥♥♥ you",Not Recommended

																This game is meant to sell, not play. They invested all of their efforts into things like pointless weather effects and completely unnecessary scale so they could use them as selling points instead of investing in gameplay. And because of that ridiculous scale, they decided to throw in as many vehicle as possible without thinking of balancing them, Again to use the spectacle as a selling point.They swapped classes, a battlefield staple, for specialists because they would be easier to monetize. They got rid of so many great details and gameplay additions from old battlefields, so they could focus on making the game more sellable, not playable.They practically got rid of all sense of community by getting rid of voip, scoreboards, clans, and all chat.And not to mention how absolutely horrible the performance is. I am fortunate enough to have a pretty solid pc, (10900k, 3080) i get constant stutters ranging from 50 to 90 fps on settings meant for performance. I cant imagine how they expect people who have been getting screwed over by scalpers from getting components to play this game.The ONLY redeemable thing about this game is portal. It offers a great nostalgia trip and has a lot of potential. Unfortunately since people went straight to abusing it which i have no clue how dice didn't see that coming, its basically impossible to level up with right now.I could honestly go on but i think the part that is the most disappointing thing about all of this is that this game was labeled as ""a love letter to fans"" before it was even revealed, yet here they are ignoring feedback on what fans want.",Not Recommended

 Battlefield 2042 Review Firstly, personally I think It's sad people defend this game. I WANT this game to be good, very badly, I did spend $140 AUD for the ultimate edition since the beta felt really good, better than this main release somehow. So I've been here playing the base game for a while, and now you don't have to spend any money. I played 30 hours so YOU don't have to. Firstly I don't care about $140, to the people in the comments, you manage your money and I'll manage mine, you're not my accountant. Based on the 3000 + helpful votes I've stopped over 100+ people spending money on this game so It's 100% worth it, I've made EA and Dice lose more money I than I've given them (Not that they'd care), use common sense before you comment. Will also attach some videos down the bottom to show / prove what I talk about in this review.This game has much potential, but in its current state it’s frustrating, badly optimised and doesn’t function as it should. Most of the time when I'm shooting I feel like a stormtrooper. I often find this game being more annoying than exciting with the current build and bugs. This should not have been released yet in my honest opinion, I'll elaborate further after the pros and cons and attach short video proof of the issues I am experiencing.Pros:1.	Has great potential2.	Gun play feels ""okay""3.	Has a decently classic battlefield feel4.	Funny ♥♥♥♥ happens here and there, as it should with battlefield5.     You can do cool stuff like the previous games (For example wingsuit, cancel it mid-air, pull out a launcher and blast someone, then continue to wingsuit again I'll attach a video down the bottom of what I mean)Cons:1.	Bloom, the bloom is horrible, just find out yourself if you dare. Bloom takes away any skill and makes fights come down to luck which is just horrible for anyone who is half decent at aiming.2.	Hit registration doesn’t work (Proof below)3.	Feels more like a beta4.	Has barley any guns or vehicles5.	Specialist challenges are just unreasonable6.	No specific classes, so everyone can just run whatever they want, it doesn’t feel right and it’s annoying because every has lock on rockets now, not just engineers7.	Horribly optimised, there are some fixes, and I am now at 200+ fps, but  THESE DON'T WORK FOR EVERYONE , some 3090 systems are struggling to get 100 fps. (Fix will be attached down the bottom with other vids) 8.	It’s currently a buggy mess, like any EA game in the early stages9.	It doesn’t have a 2.4 user review out of 10 because it’s currently good10.	No scoreboards (Someone on reddit made a fully working one for 2042 like the old games in 3 hours... That's pathetic Dice, may as well be Skyrim at this point and let the community make your game better...11.	No classes12.	No destruction13.	No servers14.	No stats (Proper ones like the old games)15.	No all chat16.	Connection errors (lots) this will be even worse at main launch17.         I think cars and hovercrafts are too strong, it's 3 C4 or known as (C5) in this game to destroy one18.         Character customization is so bad, such a missed opportunity, the AI looks so much cooler than the snowflake characters 19.         Pretty much every under barrel attachment does the SAME thing, (4 of them have the same stats)It tries to be a mix of Warzone, Fortnite, R6 Siege, Apex and so on, and it’s kind of failed. This is an unfinished, unpolished and broken game as of now.There are bugs all over the place, glitching through the ground, airborne tanks, crab walking infantry, and ground sniffing soldiers moving at breakneck speed. (I’ll attach the glitching through walls vid too, it’s not even good like cod because you can’t even shoot people)I'm a little taken aback by how awful this game is. There is no scoreboard, only four firearms per class, mediocre specialists who take away the sense of true customisation, terrible servers, unreliable controls, the inability to resuscitate friends for no apparent reason. This game was far from ready for release.The sound is horrible, and you can't tell where someone is approaching.I actually think this will be a really good game, eventually. But for now, steer clear if you want my completely honest opinion…Another classic example of greedy corporate people pushing out a half-baked game to meet their $$$ quota, that know nothing about the game, I actually feel sorry for the developers. No developer would in their right mind would release this, they must have tested it I mean come on.Do not buy this until everything is fixed! P.S The portal mode is fun though!

You have to leave the game.- Bug that will show your team mates as enemies and they can knife you to death- Only 22 weapons, of which 2 are actually good.- Attachments unlocked that are cosmetic only.- Some attachments do the opposite of what the description gives.- XP disabled in custom portal games- Attachment progression disabled in AoW Solo / Squad matches.- Crashes and disconnects- Persistence data error that makes the game unplayable.- Only two modes on 7 maps for AoW that feels like you are playing wide open fields.- Control points in breakthrough mode on top of skyscrapers what can't be captured because there are 11 vehicles on top.- Hit registration, or lack there of. You will dump an entire clip into an enemies back to have them turn around and kill you.- You can get in a vehicle and shoot and kill yourself because the animation still has you outside of the vehicle.- Crap FPS on the highest end systems. Changing the settings makes virtually no difference.- No stats page- No server browser- Lobby disbands after every game, no carryover- No distinctions between factions except the glow stick colors. Soldiers around the world wear glow sticks to make themselves unseen to the enemy. Sometimes you see the Betty White specialist kill the other Betty White specialist who is then revived by the Betty White specialist.- When you spawn in you are forced into an animation of chambering a round that you can't avoid. If you spawn near an enemy, you are dead.- Not nearly enough destruction.- Can't change the scale of the UI, or the zoom of the minimap.- No all chat- No bullet damage on hit, this goes for vehicle hits too.- Finding yourself on the map or the mini-map can be... challenging.- You can't dive under water but...- You can fall through the map- Portal- No single player campaign that was left out to focus on the multiplayer.- No spectator mode- No community servers- No test range- No 3d spotting- No contextual leaning- No crouch sprinting- No scope zeroing- No tiered or paused reloads- No melee weapon choices- No thermal optics in the future- No Claymores- No first person takedowns which are different based on positioning.- No naval vehicles- No gunner direction indicator- No TV missles- No vehicle kill assists. Do 95% of the damage... Well, too bad.- No in-game VOIP at launch- No static weapon emplacements- No infantry focus maps. You will get farmed by vehicles.- UI is...well...interesting- Impossible to play with more than 3 friends.There is more, but I'm tired of typing. Take it for what you will.",Not Recommended

																First up. Been part of the Battlefield community since BF2, BF2142, BF3, BF4 & BFV. I've watched this franchise grow and fell hard during BFV but then made it up for the issues by giving their all through the Pacific Storm update... before getting sent to the firing line for the development of BF2042.A let down for me. I don't know what to feel when i play this game. I know its Battlefield, but it feels ""off"". Movement feels COD-ish, like its snappy and fast, in an odd way. Its not as smooth as it was in BFV. Hell, BFV actually polished up movements and it felt realistic for me, its immersive.Performance is terrible. I'm getting inconsistent fps of 45-55. Especially on the main gamemode of 2042: All-Out-Warfare. Rubberbanding, gpu bottleneck, a lot of issues really. The update that they released helped a lot for many, but not on my end. BF Portal runs better and is a lot more fun.There's a lot of polished up features were removed that made Battlefield; Battlefield. I don't wanna list it out because you guys can just find it on the net. Audio mixing is... bad? it's too quiet. It doesn't pump my blood out like how the older titles did. I can go on and on and on but thats for another day. To you lot who've been with BF for a long time. 2042 is a no-go. There's so much features removed thats been polished up by BF1 and BFV that it makes 2042 feel off. An identity crisis? Apex-COD-Battlefield i dont know.To those of you who is pretty new to the franchise? Just hop onto BF4, BF1 and BFV. I can guarantee you that you'll save money AND have muuuch more fun than what 2042 is offering at the moment.As for me? I'll keep this game in my library. I'll see through this game for u bois. Im taking a shot for yall. Damn, this review is all over the place. Just like 2042's entire core gameplay. Adios",Not Recommended

																15 Critical things AOE2 and AOE3 players need to know going into AOE41. Resource drop points are back from AOE2, which means resource upgrades were moved from the market back to the stockpile buildings. You'll be building wood camps, mining camps, and granaries again.2. There are now super boars on the map that give a ton of food when hunted, but need a bunch of gatherers to take down.3. No more batch training unless you're the Mongols or the Russians. Build more barracks, archery ranges and stables as a result.4. All civs age up the same way the AOE3 Asian Dynasties do: You pick one of two wonder options (You can only pick one unless you're the Chinese), you build the wonder, you age up. The only exception is the abbasid, who add upgrades to a wonder they start with in age 1 instead. 5. There's a new influence mechanic that boils down to something similar to the Hausa: If you build certain buildlings in proximity with one another, you get bonuses. Farms near granaries are an example.6. AOE2 Wonder Victory is back, where if you build a wonder (Not the age up wonders, a bigger more expensive one) and hold it for a set time you win the game. With this, turtling is now a viable strategy again. 7. AOE3 Trade Monopoly Victory is now Sacred Site Victory, where if you can capture all the sacred sites with monks and keep at least one unit on each of them until the 10 minute timer runs out, you win the game. This is mostly a counter strategy to 6, valuing aggressive play and map control. (Stack villagers on the points to hold them longer if you're going for the final countdown)8. Markets are different, where you build trade caravans and have them cross the map going to specific trade buildings rather than town centers to make gold. 9. Walls are actually awesome now, and you can stack ranged troops on stone walls to deter enemies. Any archers on walls get 2/3rd damage reduction. You actually need siege equipment to take stone walls down too, adding extra layers of strategy to siege gameplay. 10. Farms don't cost anything to reseed anymore. No more wasting a bunch of wood on farm regrowth.11. Animals don't decay now, so don't worry about your villagers killing a bunch of sheep by accident anymore.12. You can't wall with buildings anymore, as your units and enemy units can go between them. This means no more units getting stuck, but this also makes walls even more important than before. 13. No more infinitely burning buildings, as they will eventually burn down if lowered to around a quarter health without being repaired. 14. Siege weapons are no longer dragged by horses, which is a big regression on their aesthetic from AOE3. I hope they end up changing it eventually. They do still have AOE3 setup times though, so you can't kite with them like in AOE2. 15. Sheep will now follow scouts around, but move extremely slowly and have barely any vision without them. No more sheep scouts in the early game. Feel free to comment anything I missed",Recommended

																I've been playing Age of Empires since I was around three or four years old. I mean that very literally, too. Age of Mythology and Age of Empires II were games I was raised with. I have distinct memories of being a toddler and my mother pulling me onto her lap, putting my hands on a keyboard and mouse, and teaching me how to play these games. I instantly fell in love. When I was a kid I even got Age of Empires: Mythologies on the Nintendo DS (which, Microsoft, please port to mobile devices-- it's perfect for those devices and I'd play it literally all of the time if given the chance).It's been over two decades since I first put my hands on a keyboard and mouse, and I am an adult now. During that time I've devoted my life to the study of history, explicitly because of these games. The Age of Empires series has inspired me to go to University and seek out a degree in Classical Civilizations / Mediterranean study, with special focus on Graeco-Roman paganism of the late Roman Empire. And all of that is because of little me playing the Age series.So, needless to say, I identify as a Age of Empires superfan. Don't get confused-- I'm not good at these games. I'm rather suboptimal in my gameplay approach, and disabilities of mine prevent me from being able to pay attention to as many tasks as I should be. But when Microsoft began restructuring its Xbox brand and it began making commitments to PC gaming and began developing interests in its older IPs, I held my breath. I was praying we would see an Age of Empires IV and, most especially, an Age of Mythology II. We didn't get the latter, but oh Gods was I screaming my head off when the former was announced. And now it's here. And I can't get enough.I feel that I am experienced enough with the series to give my opinion on how Age of Empires IV does compared to the rest of the franchise. The short of it is that, in my opinion, Age of Empires IV mechanically manages to be the best Age of Empires title. Yes, it lacks as many civilizations as Age of Empires II-- however, I find that many of the civilizations in Age of Empires II were ""as wide as an ocean, as deep as a puddle."" Often just reskins with a couple of unique units, maybe a gimmick, and cosmetics that make them feel distinct. However, with Age IV, the only civilizations I feel are roughly ""samey"" are the English and the French. Other than these, each civilization feels like a genuinely different experience altogether. For example, the Mongols are extremely unique, able to pick up their entire civilization and go on the move to a new part of the map to find new resources. In short, Age IV does the smart decision of sacrificing width for depth. My main disappointment in this regard is that we don't get to play the Roman Empire (or ""Byzantines"", an anachronistic term) right now, which were my favourite faction in Age II (for obvious reasons as a Classicist).One thing I love is how the campaigns are presented. I'm not a Medievalist, I'm a Classicist-- I'm much more familiar with what you might expect to find in Age 1 than Age 2/4. As someone ignorant about the medieval era, I found the documentary style of the campaigns quite fascinating and engaging. To someone who is a visual learner, I found it to be a great and engaging way of educating people who are unaware of medieval history. While playing the campaigns I've often found myself gawking over the introduction and epilogue scenes, and my attention completely captured by the narrator. This alone makes it obvious the game's campaigns have a substantial budget-- one only possible with Microsoft's deep pockets. The missions themselves are quite high quality and enjoyable to play through. They're not quite as cinematic as something like Age of Mythology or Age of Empires III, but they are still quite epic and sometimes some of them require actual clever thinking, and have that same narrator to guide you through-- which helps give the entire game a general documentary feeling.Asides this, there are just general enhancements and small things that make the game feel much more rewarding as a modern Age of Empires experience. Farms are no longer annoying (yes Age II had annoying farms), castle walls actually feel very important in Age IV-- units can even walk on them (and, with that, siege engines become more interesting-- you can get an army on those walls and in their city if the enemy isn't careful), the game rewards you well for good city building with some nice bonuses, and other small changes here and there that just feel overall convenient. Something that's mostly cosmetic but still appreciated are the languages-- when you begin in the Dark Age, your units will speak a more archaic version of their language, and this language evolves as they age up. E.g., the English will speak Old English in the Dark Age, and will eventually begin speaking an early form of modern English by the time you get to the Imperial age.One criticism I have is the limited amount of units this game allows you to spawn at once due to the population limit. I feel like perhaps the population limit should be doubled, and in compensation perhaps borrow from Age III and allow us to spawn squads of soldiers. Another criticism I have is the limited camera-- you cannot zoom out as much as I'd honestly like.To conclude, I think Age of Empires IV is a great game, and it's the best put-together Age of Empires game overall. It's also absurdly well-optimized; my potato PC that can barely run Half Life 2 at a consistent 60fps can play this game butter-smooth at lowest settings. I pray it grows a healthy and vibrant community, that it gets lots of post-launch support, and that it marks the return of Age of Empires as a whole. I feel Relic did a great job at bringing back the series that shaped me as a person most back to life, and I just hope that we can see a new Age of Empires game set in ancient antiquity sometime (whether that be something along the lines of Age of Empires I, or something more Mythological. And P.S., if anyone from World's Edge is reading this-- as a Classicist who has in-depth knowledge of ancient religion and myth I'd be happy to help with any endeavour relating to this!).",Recommended

Age of Empires is one of the biggest representatives of the strategy game sector. Many people of my generation grew up with AoE1 or AoE2 and so the announcement of Age of Empires 4 as a more modern version of the series was greatly anticipated. After taking a first look in the game I now want to give my opinion about it (for the build 7274).POSITIVE:AI: The AI is not a cheating mess like in AoE3 DE but yet also not as skilled as in AoE2 DE. Still, it varies its tactics, often uses early rushes to put pressure on the player and can sometimes build appropriate walls.Stone Walls: Units can now be placed on stone walls. Furthermore, archers can’t shoot above them and only siege units can actually damage them, which makes them really feel like a bulwark.Recruitment Time: Due to the overall high recruitment times you won’t encounter endless waves of units and actually will have an advantage once you destroy your opponents army.Landscape and Building Graphics: While I would describe the buildings as good looking, especially the landscapes with the varying altitude levels look beautiful.Gunpowder Units: All gunpowder units from infantry to siege cannons feel very impactful due to smoke effects and sound design.Sound: The sound of this game is simply amazing! The language of the units changes depending on the age as well as on the terrain your units are and the battles feel way more authentic due to the battle noise.Technical Aspects: Regarding the technical side there is nothing I could complain about. The performance is good as well as the loading times. In my first 16 h of playing I have not experienced a CTD once.NEGATIVE:Unit Graphics: Unfortunately, the level of detail on the units is so low that they look like they were made back in 2008.Build-Up Time of Siege Weapons: Siege weapons can build up and dismantle way too quick which not only feels weird but also makes them unbalanced. Unit Pathing: Usually, the unit pathing is ok but especially if you construct siege engines on the field or have a big battle the units start ‘sliding’ alongside each other which looks ridiculous.AI Representation: The AIs have no unique names anymore (like in AoE2) and don’t mock you anymore with messages (like in AoE3) which makes them feel a bit more lifeless.NEUTRAL:UI: The UI is very minimalistic, easy to read but a bit in contrast to the otherwise colourful game.No Friendly Fire: There is no friendly fire which is especially impactful when using mangonels.Guided Missiles: Sometimes the projectiles fly in a weird arc to hit their target. On the other hand, this also means that no excessive micromanagement is necessary like dodging arrows in AoE2.Victory Conditions: The victory conditions are a little bit different compared to the older games. You don’t have to destroy your enemy completely anymore or wait for him to resign – instead you must destroy his landmarks. But this means that you can also destroy your enemy by sniping his landmarks and he will automatically loose even if he still has a running economy and/or a huge army. Also, relocating your base in case your original spawn point gets overrun is only possible if you can construct a new landmark somewhere else, otherwise you will lose.Campaigns: I haven’t played the campaigns a lot since the custom matches are the major aspect of Age of Empires. So, I can’t say much about them. I only noticed that the video scenes between the missions were incredibly well made. But somehow, I have the feeling that resources which were spend for this should rather have been invested in the unit models.Population Limit: The population limit is currently 200 which feels balanced and sufficient. Still, it can be seen a bit like a downgrade compared to the custom population limit of the other parts of the series.Civilisations: The base game has currently 8 civisations which are very different and have their own mechanics each. This might seem like a loss compared to the 20+ civilisations in AoE2 DE but on the other hand they really offer different play styles. Only the unit variety feels a bit lacking since all of them share the same base units.MISSING FEATURES/IMPROVEMENTS:Map EditorCustom Player ColoursMod Support'Random' Option for Civilisation SelectionAll in all, Age of Empires 4 is a great game. Especially, if you can play it with some friends. Though, 60 € is a bit too expensive. I think a price of 40 to 50 € would be more reasonable.",Recommended

ProsIt feels like a sequel to Insurgency.  The fundimentals of Insurgency are there... you have your objective based game modes that reward teamwork, dead aim hipfire mechanic, lethal gunplay, and a realistic middle eastern setting.The sound is top notch.  Every sound you hear has some pretty advanced audio effects applied to them, so you can tell if someone is talking from the other side of a wall, shooting from inside a building, etc.Blood & gore.  If a player is close enough to wall when they are shot, their blood will get sprayed onto the surface and streak down.  Arms, legs, heads... depending on the damage the player recieved, they won't always stay attached.    Makes everything feel that much more lethal.Sandstorm has vehicles but it's still very much an infantry shooter.  They make for good rapid attack/transport vehicles, or as a static weapon platform to lock down a lane... but you'll rarely see them driving around as fighting vehicles laying waste to infantry.  They're highly vulnerable to small arms fire.Fire support is strong enough to be effective, while still being easily countered/avoided.  Fire support ranges from smoke mortars, HE artillery, to gas/rocket attacks and different types of air support.  But each one is easily countered by simply staying inside, shooting it down, or putting on a gasmask.  However, it can still change the pacing of the round enough for the attacking team to move up and gain a better foothold.Official servers perform very well.  There's the occasional hiccup if a ton of stuff is happening, but otherwise the servers are running at 60 tick which feels very fluid & solid on UE4.In typicial NWI fashion, there will be modding & long term support for this game.  If you're totally new to the Insurgency franchise, it's worth noting that the devs have a long history of providing free content for their games for years  to come.  New maps, weapons, gamemodes, animations, etc. were all added to Insurgency years after release.  The Insurgency that I bought in 2014 is not nearly as cool as the Insurgency that I can open up now.ConsFrametimes can be inconsistent for some users.  Some users report inconsistent frametimes, while others on even lower-end hardware report super smooth gameplay.  The devs have stated that optimization is the #1 priority, and while they've made HUGE improvements from only a month or two ago, it could use some more love.  But given the long history of this dev team with their other titles, there's no reason to think that this won't be addressed.  I think the fact that the game is slated for a console release is a very good thing in this regard because any optimization they perform here on PC should transfer over well to smooth console gameplay.  If your PC is stronger than a XBox (and it probably is), you'll be in good shape for Sandstorm.Other ThoughtsThe game's logic is mostly single threaded.  Like most games... having fewer, faster cores is more important than having a bunch of slower ones.  For this reason, my 4770k from 2013 runs this game well, while a more recent budget CPU may struggle.It takes a bit for things to load in if you install to a mechanical HDD.  Some users still install the game onto regular HDD's which have trouble loading assets fast enough which can result in temporary invisible hands, longer map loading times, etc.  Since SSD's are so common these days I didn't feel like this is a mark against the game, it's more of a protip.",Recommended

																Ever since I played Insurgency 2014, I’ve never seen anything quite like it in terms of immersion, intense close quarters combat, and satisfying gunplay. So when I heard there was a sequel in the works, I was interested to see how it turns out. And after months of playing the Alpha and Beta phases, the game is now finally released.GameplayInsurgency: Sandstorm at its heart is a fast-paced tactical shooter. In order for the game to feel immersive, the HUD is minimalistic, and crosshairs are nowhere to be found. Firearms are a real threat and a couple of shots are enough to drop the enemies. For this reason, the gunplay is extremely satisfying. On top of that, an extensive arsenal of weapons is available to players to choose from. Currently, Sandstorm offers a Co-op mode vs bots and three PvP modes for small and large battles, with more content planned to be added after the launch. Other new additions include bigger maps, fire support, and vehicles.Visuals and SoundThe game looks very good, and weapons have been modeled with extreme attention to detail. Maps are now considerably bigger, and the added detail makes them more believable. There is a broad range of customizations available for the characters and seldom do they look similar. However, character models look lifeless, and their moving animations feel off.When it comes to sound design, Sandstorm truly shines. The Arabic accent of the Insurgents is superbly done. The explosions are deafening and powerful weapon sounds contribute to the enjoyment of gunplay. Further, gunshots sound different depending on the shooter’s position. Sandstorm is the kind of game that needs to be played with a good pair of headphones.PerformanceThe game’s performance has improved considerably since the start of the Beta phase, but it’s still nowhere as smooth as its predecessor. Overall, its optimization leaves a lot to be desired. While the game runs fine most of the time, occasional hiccups and frame drops are to be expected. Moreover, in my time with the game, I’ve witnessed all manners of bugs and glitches. Hopefully, given time, most of these issues will be patched.VerdictAs much as I enjoyed Insurgency: Sandstorm, It’s not a game for everyone. Playing it requires a bit of time, patience, teamwork and strategy and is aimed towards more mature players. As a long-time Insurgency fan, I was hyped for Sandstorm and the final product does not disappoint. I highly recommend checking the game out if you are interested in tactical shooters.",Recommended

																I have played Insurgency Sandstorm since it came out. I have watched the game evolve into what it is today.

Insurgency: Sandstorm,"Posted: 4 May
Insurgency: Sandstorm is the Forza: Horizon of military shooters.What do I mean by that? Well, it's not a hardcore simulation, like ARMA or the Gran Turismo games. But it also isn't arcade level shenanigans like Battlefield or Need for Speed. The game is very high lethality, and high recoil. An unmodified gun can kill just as easily as a heavily customized one, and the time to kill is as short as you can get; but the action is fast, and the controls are responsive. To borrow a term from its racing genre brethren, Insurgency sits very comfortably in simcade territory.Now to be fair, I only play co-op. I have zero interest in the e-peen measuring contest that is competitive PvP, those days are long since past (circa Day of Defeat: Source and CoD4: Modern Warfare). So if you want an opinion on the competitive aspect of the game, look elsewhere, I simply don't have an opinion on it. That being said, co-op allows for playing with friends or randos in a much more relaxed setting, that can still cause the adrenaline to pump when needed (i.e. being the last one alive while defending the final objective, you have a minute plus left to hold the point, and you're outnumbered a dozen to one by the opposing team of respawning bots).The bread and butter of co-op is Checkpoint, in which you and up to seven other hapless goons partake in a fight to move across a map by capturing (and then maybe defending) or destroying various objective, opposed by a team of respawning bots that always outnumbers you. If you die, you stay dead until your surviving teammates can succeed at the next objective, triggering a team wide respawn. Rinse and repeat until the final objective, which needs to be defended for an extended period of time against an unending onslaught. Rinse and repeat across various maps until you get bored. That's the Checkpoint game mode in a nutshell, and it's what I play 99.9% of the time.They also recently added in, with update 1.10 Operation Exodus, a new co-op mode called Survival. Same as above, except everybody starts out with pistols only, the order of objectives is randomized, and completing an objective rewards you with a randomly generated primary weapon. So if you were ever afraid of the game getting stale, this mode tosses in a lot of RNG to keep things mixed up and feeling fresh. Play Checkpoint on a specific map long enough, and you'll start to develop a 'feel' for the AI; where it usually goes and how it'll typically act. Survival takes all that accumulated 'feel' and chucks it right out the window, cause you're moving all over the map at random. Bots can, and will, come at you from all angles with no rhyme or reason. It really does keep you on your toes, while also forcing you to deal with random (and sometimes nearly unusable) primary weapon configurations to boot. I've tried it, still prefer Checkpoint myself, but I both get the appeal and think it's a smart addition.That being said, the weapon selection is pretty great, containing the expected rogue's gallery of modern and retro firearms. You have the always appreciated Cold War era G3, FAL, M16, AKM, up through the more modern offerings like the AUG, M4, AK-74, FAMAS, plus quite a few more (and a few new ones added every major update). The arsenal also includes some notable pieces of downright archaic hardware, such as the WWII era Grease Gun, Garand, Welrod, and the Mossin Nagant to name but a few. The customization is rather robust, with a wide selection of optics and other hardware attachments on offer, with availability determined by class selection (i.e. only Demolitions get underbarrel launchers with explosive grenades, everyone else is limited to smoke munitions). Each mode has its own amount of supply points to spend on your loadout, and the various weapons and attachments have their own cost in supply. So if you want a super tricked out rifle (optics, supressor, extended mags, recoil grip, the works), you can do it, but at the expense to the rest of your kit; such as doing without armor, a secondary, or grenades. You want an M4A1 with a 2x holographic sight, a masterkey underbarrel shotgun, drum mags, and a supressor? Sure, you can be that guy at the gun range. Myself? I enjoy a supressed G3 with ironsights, it gets serious work done.Matchmaking just works, but there is also a server browser and mod support for custom servers. I only play the vanilla game, but even at 3am and the game listing only ~1.3K people playing, I can get into a game in under a minute (and usually much quicker than that). You get in, pick your class, your kit (fully customizable loadouts with class restricted equipment, create as many different loadouts as you want), and get to work. Play aggressively, push forward, and complete the objectives with your team (and be careful not to shoot them, friendly fire is a thing).Also one last thing, the Security team's Commander can call in an airstrike from an A-10 Thunderbolt II (aka Warthog). It'll strafe the designated area, complete with the noticeable delay between the explosive shells hitting the target and the distinctive 'BRRRRRRTTTTTTT' sound of its 30mm GAU-8 Avenger rotary cannon being fired. It is the best part about playing Commander as Security (sorry Assassin and Cleric, still love you too).EDIT: Before I get anymore 'but actually...' remarks in regards to Gran Turismo. Name me another racing sim with the brand recognition and cultural cache to rival it? That's what I thought. If you talk to a rando off the street they're far more likely to have a point of reference for the seminal console generation spanning series of Gran Turismo, than they are iRacing or Assetto Corsa; and that's why I used it.",Recommended

																With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:This overall game is good. It doesn't always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it really shines.The gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.The game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with the DCV, this is considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (""Darkness Zones"" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). With that said, dungeons (currently only 'The Shattered Throne', 'Pit of Heresy', and 'Prophecy') and raids (""Last Wish"" from Forsaken, ""Garden of Salvation"" from Shadowkeep, and ""The Deep Stone Crypt"" from Beyond Light) are best experienced with a team, so don't shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. 'Tis only polite). Of the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I really enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it's fine I guess, but I've never liked PvP that's dependent, at least in part, on personal progression)Don't be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.Some stuff just won't be explained in game. It's not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.For anything that you can't easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (""What are random rolls? Which do I keep?"") that we'd be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. Now is a great time to be getting into Destiny 2. You absolutely won't regret it. Take all of the pettiness and negative reviews about the game going F2P, servers crashing for less than an hour after launch (c'mon guys), or whatever else has people triggered with a massive grain of salt. The fact that a representative chunk of this game is now free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet (unless you're crazy like me). Any other questions about this game as a product (""What is weapon sunsetting? Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?"") should absolutely be researched elsewhere. [Especially now that infusion caps AKA sunsetting have been announced as being effectively rolled back, which no longer makes older content irrelevant in newer endgame activities. They also announced that the level cap increase season after season will be reduced by a significant margin, cutting down on the seasonal grind considerably. Do your research before you buy older expansions, but once both of these changes are in the game, I can wholeheartedly recommend D2 again.]If you're looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. Remember, everyone is starting at the max light level from the most recent expansion, which is great for playing with veterans without too much grinding, but means that you can miss out on the ""learning the ropes"" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain.

Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Shadowkeep's launch, with updates noted throughout.

[Updated again with the announced removal of sunsetting and lower seasonal power caps during Season 13, per https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50124]TL:DR: It's good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it's free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities.

Next is a smaller boy awkwardly swinging a big hammer. Interesting. Then you have the main character, a foolhardy girl learning alchemy. She gleefully chucks tactical nuclear warheads that eliminate every enemy within a five kilometre radius that she slapped together in a pot using a rock, a fruit and a flower.The island is none the wiser about the evolving world-ending power that is growing in their back yard in the form of a group of young optimistic adults.I would recommend to someone who wants to feel like a lazy demigod capable of causing massive damage with minimum effort.",Recommended
Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout,"Posted: 17 May, 2020
																I'm an older RPG player; I played my first computer RPG around 1986. I've played tens if not over a hundred RPGs since then and I'm very happy to be playing Atelier Ryza. This past year has been good for me as far as gaming goes - Disco Elysium, for example, was an especially important game for me.As someone with a relatively full schedule with work and such, it's rare that I take 17 hours to watch or play any media at all, but I'm already at 17 hours for A.R. and I'm looking forward to playing however many more hours there are of it. This is my first Atelier game. I've avoided them in the past because I heard that there was a time limit to them. This is probably my loss because this particular Atelier game is engaging and adorable.As you can see, the graphics are top-notch. The music isn't bad but certainly isn't on the level of something like Child of Light or the more recent Nier: Automata. The crafting system is wonderfully intricate - I'm still not sure I have it 100% figured out but I recently got to being able to rebuild things and I've spent quite a while just synthesizing things. My alchemy level is significantly higher than my battle level. :)  The story and dialog are fun and internally consistent; it doesn't challenge the reader-hearer at all but it's pleasant and doesn't detract from the experience. I like the fact that you're not a troubled hero saving the world from a planet-destroying monster. Something that would make the ""talking"" bits better, in my opinion, would be to add a dash of Persona's social systems to the mix.The battle system is very nice, with a fair number of options. It's an ATB sort of system and combines the usual elements, but it's especially cool to see things that you've worked to build in action. If you're losing your battles, it might not be because you're underleveled, but rather because you haven't spent enough time synthesizing or rebuilding your gear.I've had no technical issues whatsoever. It runs fast and without fail on my machine, a graphics workstation built late last year. I'm using an Xbox controller and I'm glad that I am.I'm not sure of what else to write. Atelier Ryza is a bit of fresh air for me and, even if I don't check out older games in the long-running series due their quest time limits, I'll definitely pick up any subsequent games in this particular arc. If anyone has any suggestions for Atelier games or for games in general, I'd be happy to hear from you in comments.",Recommended
Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout,"Posted: 19 February, 2020
IntroductionHeyo. I'm reviewing this game from the perspective of someone who's never played the rest of the Atelier series. I guess the main point that brings across is that I have no comparison to how it is when looking at the series as a whole, and instead am viewing this game by itself.Art Style & GraphicsThis has anime vibes all over it, and I love it. It looks like a modern anime game. Very visually pleasing to look at.StoryThe story starts as your typical ""I wanna get out and see the world"" type of deal and transitions to a ""I wanna save my island"", and I think as cliche as that sounds, it makes for a beautiful canvas to paint the picture of the stories of the people within very well. A few of the characters have interesting backgrounds that get revealed as the game progresses, and a lot of it has depth that surprised me in a good way. Some characters break out of the traditional character norms I tend to see just a little bit. Cliches are cliche for a reason, but it's nice to spice it up with details that make the character who they are, and this game does that well. Likewise, I enjoyed how the story progressed, and I really, really, really hope that they add sequels to this particular story. I feel that Ryza has more adventures in her future, and this may be the setup to something even better.AlchemyThere's no two-ways about it: It's clear the devs spent a lot of time creating a world full of items that you can combine that all have important uses, traits and effects that will benefit you. It also has a very elaborate and detailed crafting system (Alchemy) that you'll be spending a lot of time on. Yes, you do need to use this function to stand a chance of completing this, but it's easy and honestly insanely fun to get into.I've been looking for a game that had a crafting system of this depth for a long time, and I've finally found that in Atelier Ryza.CombatI really enjoy the combat system, and I feel that any explanation I give here would undersell it. It's turn-based, but realtime at the same time. There's a variety of things you can do, like use crafted items (think heals and bombs), skills, and normal attacks. Instead of MP, they use a system where as your party attacks the monsters, you gain AP, which you can spend to use skills. I like this better than MP, as it gets you considering other options during battle and not just spamming Y to nuke everything. Instead it's like ""If I do this thing, I can set it up so I can do this when this happens"", etc. Strategy planning is something I can dig and I'm glad to see the variety of actions you can take gives you a variety of options for combat. I'm limited in how much in-depth I can take this review, so suffice it to say I really enjoy the combat, and I think you will too.Difficulty LevelsI haven't experienced the higher difficulties yet, but on normal difficulty, once I got a handle on making good gear with Alchemy, the enemies didn't have a satisfying challenge for me. Which makes sense, if you make broken gear you're basically turning down the difficulty for yourself. It's not a fault of the game, moreso a fault of my own curiosity. I can't say how the higher difficulties are in comparison as I have yet to play through it on them, but I look forward to the challenge.Time Spent and Replay-ValueIt took me about 50 hours to complete it my first time, and that's again coming from me having never played an Atelier game in depth. I came in blind, not knowing how the combat worked, and really focusing on having a chill time enjoying the story and theorycrafting in Alchemy to figure out what will get me over the wall I'm up against. After beating the game, I want to play it all through again from scratch on the hardest difficulty for the added challenge. There is a New Game+ feature that lets you take your equips and equipped consumable items with you, but I feel like that would detract from the challenge I'm looking for personally. Looking forward to a Charismatic difficulty run, which unlocks once you beat the game for the first time.Edit: Since my initial review I actually did go back and discovered the highest difficulty is actually Legendary, and not Charismatic. It adds 1000% HP to monsters, you're permanently cursed (-10% DEF), and the monsters have higher speed stat. It's a challenge that takes OP gear into consideration. I only made OP weapons and armor, so this run I still have OP items and accessories to consider crafting.ConclusionIs this game worthwhile? Very yes. I truly enjoy this game to my heart's content and would recommend it to anyone and everyone I know. You don't need prior knowledge of the series to get into this one, so I'd consider this a great entry point to the Atelier series. That being said, I haven't played the other Atelier games, so if you're looking at the other titles, I'd check out reviews for those, as I hear those games are essentially their own entities that have their own flavor and experiences, like you'd expect from a Final Fantasy game. I think that's a good thing, and leaves plenty of room for variety.",Recommended
Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout,"Posted: 5 November, 2019
 Sum up+ Worlds full of life and creatures, rich in graphic details.+ Gameplay is energetic and fun using the battle system of action points.+ Is a good entry point for those wanting to get in the Atelier series or RPG's.+ Multiple mechanics that unlock as the player progresses through the game add layers to all gameplay aspects.+ Characters are likable and essential to the story, getting involved in a chain of events and developing traits, skills, and goals.+ Synthesis and gathering are simple enough not to become annoying but also feature deep replayability. Trying to craft the best version of items and gear.-Side quests are, for the most part, dull and pointless.-Recycle bosses, as well as a general lack of them, bring down some of the game's hype since there are no many vital enemies to defeat.- The story suffers from inconsistent pacing, it is painfully slow at first and abruptly rushed near the end of the game. There is room for improvement in getting the correct length. Introduction Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout is an RPG game that belongs to the Atelier series. It involves mechanics such as crafting and gathering more heavily than other RPGs, but it does so in a way that rather than it being it a chore, it becomes an enjoyable process of discovery and progression. The story follows a clash between respecting old traditions and cultures. Rejecting all that is not a part of those in contrast to breaking one'sone's own shell and innovating, looking to bring change, which is what the protagonist Ryza tries to do.  Combat The game uses the action point system, meaning that a character gets a turn when their portrait reaches the gap in the speed bar. Player's must progress through areas and dungeons with a party of three active characters and another three as reserves to be able to change formations and lineups. The AP system works as follows: a character can always execute a normal attack without any points, but they need them to use skills. Points are awarded by dealing with damage, killing enemies, performing joint actions, using items, or inflicting the break status.While the combat system can be simple at first, it keeps introducing more mechanics that made it more enjoyable. Using the right timing between the negative and aggressive stances feels rewarding, and some battles require quick reflexes to push through. Skills are satisfying to use, and the orders keep things interesting through multiple encounters. Boss battles are exciting thanks to game music and their design in Gameplay that becomes an adequate challenge. Regrettably, there are few bosses in the game, and some of them are just the same boss with different colors.There are also tactics levels, which you can spend your hard-earned AP in a battle to increase. This will sacrifice your immediate action potential but benefit you in the long run for that battle. There are five levels, the first three levels increase the number of regular attacks (therefore the gain of more AP) and skills evolve into more powerful versions. Level four and five give more damage, and the possibility to use fatal order. An ultimate devastating technique that can be used when it is not your turn. Synthesis and Gathering Synthesis and gathering is the other part of the Gameplay. At first, I thought it could become a bothersome element. Still, in Atelier Ryza, they made it friendly to new players while also keeping some of the extra layers of depth. They are easy to do. Still, finding out the best materials or synthesis the best versions of items is a challenging process that makes you look forward to crafting something really powerful or useful.To explain that layer of depth a bit, you can synthesis something as simple as an ingot. Then as you unlock more areas and get better materials, you can craft that ingot but make it so much better than the other ingot pales in comparison. Giving it extra effects, quality, traits, skills, and so on. You can then use that improved ingot to make better versions of existing weapons or craft powerful ones. The game follows that chain; if you want the best results, you need to gather and synthesis the best ingredients. An alchemist is only as good as their tools.For gathering, the game uses different elements in which one can interact in areas. From brushes to trees, rocks, crystals, fishing spots, bags, defeating monsters, and more, the player can gather different materials. There are also a variety of tools to gather such materials as hammers, scythes, or explosives. Depending on the tool you use, you can get one set of materials or the other from the same elements. The game doesn't tell you how to get the materials exactly but gives you hints by telling you the area in which they are and the tool to gather them.I found myself spending a reasonable amount of time with this aspect of the game. I would say gear is more important than leveling in this game as I really didn't need to grind but rather craft better equipment. Creating items to use in battle is fun. Assigning roles and having a general strategy with a lineup. It makes it feel like the choices I made outside battles, were carried into them and having a profound impact on how they play out. Story The story is good, but it does have some issues; for starters in the early parts, it has a slow start. Events move slowly, and something is artificially extended. Characters keep dealing with the same topic on different conversations, and it is sluggish. Once that early part is over, the game story does pick up, and it is a perfect one. Ryza and her friends start as dreamers on an island and becoming involved in a series of events that will change their lives forever. They are incredibly likable characters and essential figures in the story.The latest part of the game is unfortunately rushed too, one moment, you are exploring areas and finding out the truth of events. Trying to look at the bigger picture and the next moment, the game is getting ready to wrap everything up. I think the game could have been lengthier, seeing as how some aspects of the story are skipped or just beelined to the end.What I like about it is how characters have their backgrounds. Different personalities that create a diverse cast, realistic motives, strengths, and weaknesses, struggles to overcome, conflicts with antagonists, and development. Each of them is working to break out of their shell and chasing their dreams. This puts them at odds with other characters. Everyone on the island had always been taught to reject new ideas and follow long-established traditions and principles. This brings a clash to the protagonist's beliefs and goals, which are to become something more, go on an adventure, and not being afraid of change.  What Makes It Special What makes Atelier Ryza unique is that it is a good entry point for new players of the series and those that would like to try out a more straightforward RPG. That simplistic approach is not a bad thing, it makes for an easier to digest the experience. It doesn't overstay its welcome, bringing new mechanics and elements to add some layers as well as avoiding getting stale. Conclusion Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout is a solid RPG game. The story has some problems but is overall an enjoyable ride. The choices made outside of encounters carry into it, making synthesis and gathering a core aspect rather than an extra or side diversion. Combat is fun, and unleashing skills, or taking extra turns is rewarding if done right. Worlds are full of life, and the environments are beautiful. If you want to get into the RPG genre or the Atelier series, this game is for you.  Follow our curator page, OCG if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.",Recommended
Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout,"Posted: 2 March, 2020
 Thicc Thighs Saved The Franchise Disclaimer: Before I go into this review, I'd like to point out: I am not a longtime fan of the series. Like many, people saw the game pop up in an ad and saw the thighs. To me, I saw it as a pre-order ad and liked the artstyle. I looked up a gameplay video on it and then knew what others were talking about lol, but the combat looked really neat so I gave the series a follow. Then I saw the alchemy gameplay and got REALLY confused what was going on. Seeing it was $60, I was skeptical. So I did some research on a good place to start. Then I picked up Sophie on PS4 and enjoyed it enough to try it out on here. So what the heck is Atelier? From the experience of what I played and researched, the Atelier series is an RPG series with an alchemy focus developed by Gust and published by Koei Tecmo (You probably know KT from games like Dynasty Warriors, Ninja Gaiden, Dead or Alive, etc.).Rather than games starting off with conflict so intense, Atelier is more focused on a ""slice-of-life"" RPG, where the main protagonist(s) of each game starts off their adventure and learns alchemy. Instead of just mindlessly grinding to kill a boss at the end of the dungeon to progress the story with side quests along the way, the Atelier series has a flow of three categories: Exploration, combat, and synthesis. I'll explain my opinion on that later. Atelier Ryza's Review  Pros +Great character development+The world you explore looks small but feels big and makes it fun to explore and gather materials without fast travelling constantly.+Unique twist on turn-based combat in that it's real-time as well. Seamlessly switch party members for efficiency.+Alchemy. The core mechanic of the series. Synthesis items to use in combat or gather in areas. No two items will be the same.*(Example: I want to make a bomb, but I have made one that just deals more damage than usual. I want to make a new one, but instead of just high damage, I'll keep it about average and maybe add burn DoT. My last bomb has properties that made the bomb stronger, but this one could also drop an enemy's defense.)+Great soundtrack** Cons -Not the greatest story. Very ""slice-of-life"", has a hard focus on what it should be about sometimes.-Stiff animations during cutscenes. Not a big developer, so not a hard loss. I see those expectations from big companies.-Japanese dub only, but only con if player prefers English only.-Bad optimization. Launcher with limited options. Also at launch, lacked kb+m but now patched.-Needs more boss fights.-Option to switch party members in battle. Just nitpicky for that one.*I kinda prefer the Mysterious' ""Tetris-style"" synthesis system than the skill-tree system in Ryza, but still fun to use.**I say it's good, but mostly for the series in general, which you can add previous OSTs. Ryza's battle BGM is repetitive and generic, but the rest is nice. You can listen to it on Spotify.Overall, it's a good game for a niche series. I'd definitely recommend it on a sale or an earlier entry if you're skeptical though. Just to be safe.9/10",Recommended
Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout,"Posted: 26 July, 2020
																Atelier Thicc is a fantastic little game. I have never played any of the Ateliers before, or seen the Anime (if there is one) and the game had been on my radar for a while but I was unsure as it looked like one of those games where unless you've played since the start, you won't know what the thicc is going on. Thankfully, this is not the case. Anyone can pick this up and as far as I can see, it has no references to previous titles and it is its own game. The premise to start with is pretty basic, you follow 3 friends, Thicc, Tao and Lent, all who yearn for adventure. They're all stuck on their own little island with a peaceful village but have the taste for adventure. The game is an (intended) slow start, this may put people off but it shouldn't. There's no impending threat of doom and the gang just want to explore. The first couple of chapters is more of a long tutorial, getting you to grips with the thiccness of the thighs, alchemy, battle etc but as someone who can not stand hand holding in games, this does not do that thankfully. The tutorials themselves are fairly unintrusive. As stated, it starts off slow, the story is not bad by any stretch, but it isn't anything to wow you. It is probably intended more for the younger audience but as a fully grown adult, it is fine. The writing isn't superb but the translation is perfect and it has a professional feel to it, as though it is done by a proper developer team (which, it is. KT imo make some great games) but I state this because a lot of anime-style titles can be a bit, let's say all over the place. I want to emphasis on this fact that the story, writing is not bad at all, but it is the weakest aspect of the game. Having read some of the reviews, some are idiotic. Someone tries to claim after an hour of play that Ryza is basically fan service with two giant tumours on her chest. Just no. This is not one of those games and has no fan service and is suitable for any audience, in fact, the reviews came off as jealous and childish. Aesthetically this is a really beautiful game. Graphically it isn't impressive though. Playing at 1440p there is aliasing but it is minor. Some textures are pretty low resolution, and there are few graphical options, but none of this matters because it is still an incredibly gorgeous looking game. Zones are small (though very numerous!) and there's no loading time between them. There is a day night cycle, with rain for weather. Animations are good and believable. The UI is fantastic, crisp, clean and attractive. Sound wise it's all good, voice acting is amazing as you'd expect from a Japanese title (have not listened to English) and sound effects are decent enough. The music is...there. It is polished and professional, and clearly studio quality and it's very typical of JRPG's, although it is not something I would listen to out side of the game. This is purely a personal choice though, there is nothing wrong with it. Gameplay is addictive! Before I bought the game, I checked it's length and I saw around 25-30 hours to beat. For me, this is a little on the low side for a J-RPG but it's very obvious this is if you're PURELY going through the main story ignoring everything else. I'm 14 hours in and to be honest, I've only just finished the second chapter ""taking your first steps"" because I've enjoyed playing with the alchemy, doing the side quests (which are short, non voiced and not needed but good rewards) and grinding in combat. This handles the flow extremely well. What I often hate, or despise about Japanese titles is their insane amount of talking about nothing, forcing you through long cut scenes and making it impossible to quit the game if you need to go out. Thankfully, this does not do that and handles it PERFECTLY. While there are a lot of cutscenes, they are very short, and it gives you a choice to do whatever you want between them. For example, if you need to go somewhere, make something etc, you'll get a short cutscene but it tells you that you can go make the item then explore, or practice alchemy etc or you can just wait a day (rest in bed) and progress. Now, that sounds fairly typical of a lot of games I guess, though it's hard to explain. In short, you're not pushed to do anything, you're not sucked into long cutscenes that take forever to finish and the need to talk to 1274 people before you can save. Now for the alchemy. At the start, it's pretty basic but it does open up and has a lot of depth to it. The way you apply stats or quality, abilities etc is fantastic, and highly addictive. I didn't think I would like this aspect of the game, but I love it. Combat is simple to start with, but again, opens up a bit later. Optimisation is something I can't help you with. For me I am getting 100 FPS @ 1440p with the game maxed out. This feels very low to me, since I am running a Strix 1080 TI OC 12GB, 8700k and 16GB 3200MHZ. As stated, it's aesthetically beautiful, but with it's graphics I'd expect it to cap my 165hz display. I'd expect any mid range PC could run this at 1080p/60 easily though, but I would be sceptical of budget PC's. Overall, it's a fantastic game. Albeit expensive. I did not buy the digital deluxe version and honestly, I don't think you need it. The game does not throw it's RMT's in your face, so once you've started the game you won't see there's extra DLC, basically, I mean it feels like a full package. The deluxe version only gives costumes I believe anyway, except for some MINOR items that aren't needed. In closing, Atelier Thiccness is a fantastic title to start for any age.",Recommended

																I promise to finish this review without talking about ""thighs"". So, this was a pretty wholesome, cute adventure. I like that the story isn't just about saving the world, and it has a more slice of life feel too it. Combat is also pretty cool and different from your traditional JRPGs, but I do wish characters got more abilities when leveling up. Game ran fine at 60fps most of the time, only crashed once during a 40h playthrough. If you like crafting, there are a ♥♥♥♥ ton of ♥♥♥♥ to collect from poisonous flowers to peaches to burnt wood to trash to corpses - Ryza uses anything and anyone to improve her alchemy. Very very tight game, recommended.",Recommended

Full review (including score): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nNeiH-fMkWritten review below!The rundown:Pros:+ Best looking Atelier to date+ Fun new combat system+ Excellent crafting mechanicsCons:- Sloppy writing- Filler story content- Subpar PC portFor the third time this year, the Atelier series makes an appearance on PC. Atelier Ryza is the 21st game in the series and has also already become the fastest selling Atelier game to date, selling nearly 4x as many copies in the first week as Atelier Lulua did. Now, I’m sure a lot of that was fueled by the massive amount of fan art for the game’s main character, but there’s actually a pretty good game underneath all of those thighs.Note: Had to trim review to fit char limit, check vid for full version!Pros:Best looking Atelier to date. As someone that played Lulua earlier this year, what immediately set Ryza apart was just how good it looked. Sure, the game maintains the same light fantasy aesthetic and runs on the same engine as Lulua, but it changes just enough to give it its own unique look. This includes some heavily upgraded lighting/shadows, much better facial animations, and some very cool cinematic-style cutscenes instead of characters just blankly talking back and forth. Of course, the new character designs are also worth mentioning. They’ve been done so in such a way as to fit the new direction the series is going for, one that’s less frilly and more adventurous. They’re a nice change of pace for the series and look great in-game.Ryza doesn’t just set the bar with its visuals though, its music is also pretty good for the series. It also maintains that light fantasy theme that the series is known for, but mixes it with Ryza‘s more adventurous direction. You get your upbeat tropical tracks for the game’s island setting, a similarly upbeat battle theme that fits the new combat system, and a bunch of other cool tracks for each of the game’s locations. It’s a much better overall music than Lulua and one that I’ll definitely be revisiting in the future.Fun new combat system. Instead of opting for a more traditional turn-based combat system like the last 20 games, Ryza instead has real-time turn-based combat. This means that, while the combat itself is done in turns, it all takes place in real-time, so there’s no sitting around contemplating what your next move should be — you have to make decisions on the fly and quickly.It all works via an action bar on the left side of the screen. Both party members and enemies all move down this action bar and are able to make a move once they reach the bottom, at which point their position will be reset on the bar dependent on the wait time of the move they just moved. Some moves are quick and place you only a little bit up on the bar whereas others are more powerful and reset you all the way to the top. On top of that, there’s a bunch of other combat mechanics to keep track of, including tactics level, action points, core charge, and party formations. It was honestly a bit overwhelming at first, but after a few hours playing around with it, I grew to appreciate just how different it was.Excellent crafting mechanics. And of course, it wouldn’t be an Atelier game without the complex crafting system, which in this series takes the form of alchemy. Everything in the game, including exploration, combat, and even major points in the story are tied to this system. New areas you explore will have new materials to synthesize, which in turn can be made into weapons, armor, bombs, and healing items to be used in combat.The crafting itself is very complex and I oftentimes found myself combining upwards of 10 or so materials together just to make a single item up to spec, which I would then turn around and use to make another item and so on. There’s a lot to take into account here, including item elements, quality levels, and traits, all of which need to be considered if you want to get the highest-possible item effects. In fact, I was pretty much able to make up for the level gap between many of the game’s enemies and my own party due to just how refined my equipment was.As with the combat system, it was a bit overwhelming at first, but again, all it took was a few hours to get the hang of things. It definitely helped that the game slowly introduces these crafting mechanics over the course of the story, so you’re given ample time to adjust to how it all works. It was fun to experiment with and ended up being one of my favorite parts to the game.Cons:Sloppy writing. As much as I may like the Atelier series, the writing is definitely not one of its stronger points and Ryza is no exception. It falls victim to the same “starts out okay and then slowly deteriorates” pattern that the last game fell into, but this time in a much shorter time period. I say that because the game this time around is much shorter than the last, only taking me about 18 hours to clear. In that time period, you’ll see plenty of the same old JRPG tropes, rushed story developments, and bland characters that not only plague this series, but the genre as a whole. I will give the game some credit for actually having a pretty good start, but by the end, the story had pretty much lost my interest.Filler story content. Now, I’m not talking filler content like full-blown Naruto filler arcs, but rather short gameplay segments that just serve to pad the game’s length. These usually took the form of simple “go here” or “wait here” quests, which had me simply teleporting to where I needed to be or waiting several in-game days to trigger the next story event. Sometimes I would even complete a task and be told to go back home and wait a day, just to return to the area I just completed that task at. There was no point to the game doing this outside of making it appear that a day had passed within the story, but that could easily have been done in a cutscene or some sort of transition.Subpar PC port. I’ll preface this by saying that the game itself actually runs fine and I had no FPS drops, stuttering, or crashes, but there’s more to a good port than just that. Ryza is a PC game that only has two graphics-related settings: a fullscreen toggle and a resolution setting. These two options are not even in the game itself, but rather in a simple launcher accessed outside of it. In that same launcher you can also configure your mouse and keyboard settings, or rather, just your keyboard settings, as the game does not appear to have any mouse support.If you do decide to play with a keyboard, you will find that the default controls make no sense and rebinding them is a bit troublesome as it only shows what each key’s corresponding button would be on an Xbox controller, rather than what the key will do in-game. As these bindings can only be changed from the launcher, you’re in for a lot of trial-and-error to find that right keyboard layout. However, even then, it just feels awkward to move around and control the camera at the same time using just a keyboard, so I would definitely recommend going in with a controller.Overall:Ryza takes the series in a bold new direction, implementing an entirely new combat system and upping the graphics along the way. However, it does this without ever losing what makes the series fun. Exploring the game world and picking up materials is still fun, combining these materials in the expansive crafting system is as well, and of course, the light fantasy aesthetic is as good as its ever been. Although the game may suffer from some sloppy writing and a subpar PC port, it is still a very fun JRPG experience and one I would definitely recommend for those looking to get into the series.Follow my Steam Curator for more reviews!",Recommended
Need for Speed™ Heat ,"Posted: 27 June, 2020
In a nutshellPros:1. Multiple types of races available2. Wide selection of vehicles3. Cops on steroids at night4. Vehicle damage added 5. Tonnes of vehicle customisation available6. Option to select difficulty level7. Good attention to details8. Wide range of player characters (both male/female) to select and customise.9. Can choose to play Solo(bots with  Easy/Med/Hard difficulty)/Friends (Party Play, up to 8 friends per party)/Multiplayer (16 players per server) .10. Car swap support before race/event start (need not travel to garage to change cars).11.  June update adds cross-play support, i.e You can play on PC and your friends can play with you using xbox or Playstation on same server.  Cons: 1. No more game updates, crossplay was the last2. A bit short in-game story.3. Need to have origin account as well to play the game.4. Cops are noob/hungover during day time, probably due to the steroids they had at night lol 5. Easy/Medium/Hard difficulty level only applies to races, not to Cops. Cops always remain on steroids at night and hungover during day.6. No cockpit camera view. For people who do not have time to read detailed review, please stop here lol  In detail review  The Game basicsThe game runs in both day and night time. Day time races gives money, night time races give reputation/rep.Day time is when legal, closed street road racing happens and You get money for placing 1st. This is needed for buying new cars and upgrading/customising them. Cops are present in day mode, but they are noob/hungover due to night steroids.Night time is where illegal street racing happens. These races give reputation which helps in moving ahead in story line and unlocking parts. Cops in the night time are on steroids. Race Types: The game has off-road races, on-road/closed road races, drift races and time trials. Each mode needs its own race settings for cars. A car tuned for on-road street races does ♥♥♥♥ for off road racing and drifting, no matter how good it is upgraded. So, if you come across a race event during free roam, just use the car swap feature to swap into best suited car for the event before the event begins. Need not travel back to garage/safe house for car change. And yes, You can replay completed races again to get extra cash. Heat Races There is also another race type called ""Heat race"" which are available only at night time and unlock only when Your car heat level is more than 3. These races take place on map where cop patrol density is higher. Each of these races give lot of Rep, and also unlocks ""Ultimate"" set of upgrades for your car (one part unlocked per race win), provided You can manage to evade the cops, i.e. their spike strips, the helicopter, the RAMs and their corvettes. Please note, its not easy to get rid of them, no structures to collapse on them and Your vehicles take heavy damage during collision too.. Pedal to the metal is not always an option here, as their corvettes are pretty fast too... More details on cops in ""Cops"" section below.  Customisation Both Vehicle and character customisation is available. Vehicle customisation is pretty detailed in this game.  From base engine customisation to exhaust tip sound and everything in between. You can either choose to upgrade the basic/default engine or swap it with a different high power engine instead (and then upgrade this high power engine), but You have to unlock them first though.You can select male or female player character and customise their appearance from hair styles to dressing sense. And each character has its own voice which suits them pretty well. Cops:EA games did one thing good with their franchise here, cops are pretty good and their spawn is very random and unpredictable. No structures to immobilise the cops, either pedal to the metal or jump across roads/canals using off road ramps, which if done incorrectly will give damage to Your car. Ramming into cops is not gonna help most of the times, as Your vehicle also takes significant damage on ramming cops.However, You can add modifications to Your vehicles to evade cops. Cop evading modifications are split into two types, active and passive. Active modifications need to be manually activated and passive modifications  gets activated when needed automatically without player intervention.Active ones include Kill switch attack protector, re-inflatable tyres, car repair kit etc. Passive ones include Radar disrupter (which makes difficult for cops to find You once You are out of their line of sight), NOS boosts, modifications to give extra damage to cops when You ram them OR stronger chassis modification to get lesser damage when cops ram You, etc. Although there are lot of cop evading modifications listed above,   only one active and one passive modification can be equipped on the car. One last thing, If Your vehicle gets lot of damage, You can drive through petrol bunks/gas stations to get it fully fixed (available during cop chases too). However, it can be done only 3 times after which, You have to enter safe house for repair. Safe houses are not accessible when active cop chases are in progress.Multiplayer: Ok, this is not something I've done a lot, usually I end up playing in Solo mode, but will share what I know..So, starting with the basics, when You play Online, You'll be joining server with around 16 players (PC/xbox/playstation together), thanks to cross play support. You can continue with Your regular game play of finishing races with bots in these server too (Just like Solo), OR You can challenge other players on the server to compete with you. However, its on other players to accept Your challenge, but if they do and You win that race, You'll end up getting bonus money/rep etc. (around 40% boost over doing it on Solo I think)Night time mp gets more exiting. If you are in a race on Your own, minding Your own business, and another player (elsewhere on map) gets into a high heat cop chase, he/she can bring entire cops on You, even if You are in between another race. Other players can take You out OR Your opponents, purely depends on Your luck.. Multiplayer Crew System: Another aspect of Multiplayer gaming is, the crew system. You can create your own crew OR join existing one by sending request. The crew leader has to approve Your request, only then can You join their crew. A crew can have 32 players.Also, crews can be levelled up from level 1 to level 50. Each level upgrade gives (to everyone in the crew) bonus perks in game, like bank/money boosts per race, rep boosts etc. Level 50 unlocks the amazing Ferrari fxx k-evo '18.To level up Your crew, You have to either complete daily challenges or beat time trails done by other crews. The more members in Your crew, the faster the crew levels up I think. This is all the knowledge I have on multiplayer aspect of this game, I might have missed things but this should be sufficient for You to get started haha..Concluding.. There might be more aspects to this game which I might have missed/not explored.. If you find something missing in the review, please do let me know in the comments. If you disagree with the review, please inform that in the comments too, but please do not be toxic in the comments just because You disagree haha. I'm all ears for your comments...Finally, Hope this long review helps!!! And thanks for spending time to read through it haha..

																This game is excellent for a short time of entertainment. If you're looking for a decent racing game, I'd recommend trying out this game. However, there are a few things that you might want to consider before buying. The good things about the game:- GRAPHICS: Graphics is a big plus. The game looks great and lovely instead of being dark and bland like the previous games. The game is much more vibrant in color, and the attention to detail is gorgeous. Particles, visual effects, textures are much more detailed and impressive. However, it might be a downside for some people as it would take up a lot of your computer's resources, in which it could make your game runs poorly as you cranked the settings to the top. Personally, the game runs smoothly for me. I have a GTX 1080Ti, ran the game with everything maxed out, and still get roughly 80fps on 1080p. I never had any hiccups or lag whatsoever. Still, I think they could do better optimization with the game. Although it is not bad, it is not good either.  - HANDLING: Handling and configurations are much better, and it's much easier for someone new to the game. On the other hand, hardcore gamers might feel this game is a lot easier than any previous game, which makes the game feels more like an arcade racing game than being another version of Forza Horizon. Nevertheless, It is much more enjoyable now, I'd say. - CUSTOMIZATION: Customization is much better as there are more options to choose from. Cosmetics and gears are not related, so you can put whatever you like in your car without worrying about the cosmetics interfering with your car's stat. There are plenty different customization for the cars depend on each one, pretty much the same to the 2015 NFS version as well. Also, you can choose outfits for your characters as well.- THE THRILLS: If you are a person who likes the feeling of being pursued, then this is the game for you. As the cops are annoying as hell, they would chase you everywhere you go. They are like your boyfriends/girlfriends as they will never let you out of their sights. On the other hand, if you do not like it, don't get it, or you'd break more controllers than you ever had. - ORIGIN TO STEAM: If you had the game on Origin and you repurchased it on Steam, it will merge the save data and let you continue where you left off. I started with Origin Access and now picked it up again on Steam, and I still have whatever cars/level/money I had.The bad things: - THE STORY: Although the story is not poorly written, it is short and predictable. You only have 4 to 5 main story missions, which you can do quite fast as soon as you have the right car. You can finish the story mode in approximately 4 hours.- TOO HARD: The difficulty is not working. Whether easy or hard, the cops are still coming at you hard like they got all the time in the world. The annoying problem is they appear from nowhere most of the time. Sometimes when you pop up your map to look for cops to evade and think they are not there, think again. Next seconds you thought it was clear; they appeared and got the whole gang chasing you. Bang! Bang! Police Gang! =))- TOO EASY: On the contrary, if you grind for money and choose to race against bots, they drive like any other track touring games out there as they'd follow exact turning/driving procedures, and not even try to speed, hit or ram you. For instance, you can see yourself sometimes might overlap the other racers even with the hardest difficulty. - TUNING/TWEAKING: If you are looking for a game that has tuning features and customization like Forza games, this game is nowhere near it. This game is more like an arcade racing game that simplified almost every aspects of car tuning with some extra entertaining features. Specifically, you choose the gears that give you the most powerful stats and suitable for your play style. The only good thing is there are multiple different engines to choose from. But as soon as you swap into the other one, basically you uses the same gears part to upgrade it, nothing really special beside a boost to your car's stats and something for you to explore/build. Although tuning is not really detailed, it focus more and go back to the root of what NFS used to be. I'd say if you enjoyed the old NFS from the 2015 version and before that, I think you'd like this game too. This time around, they make it feel much more enjoyable and rewarding by how you earned the parts. Besides, you don't have to open loot boxes to get gears like Payback, which is a plus for me. - REPLAYABILITY: After grinding for gears, you pretty much don't have anything else to do unless you keep on re-doing all the driving missions to earn more money or REP (Reputation). As there are only two main things: REP (EXP) and money. After 5 hours of the main story and 10 hours of Ultimate gears grinding, I've done most of the things that the game has to offer. The game does not have other events or modes that you can participate in..Therefore, there is not much of replayability value, and it gets boring fast. Most of the tracks are circuit or sprint which are repetitive to me, nothing too special though. If you're looking for diversity, go for The Crew 2 as there are more stuffs to do than this game. However, if that does not worry you, go for it. There will be plenty of missions and race tracks for you to choose from, so that you can earn more money to buy cars and fully upgrade them. - ORIGIN: The game is still on Origin, and you just basically buy it through Steam. As the players seem to have more troubles with Origin client than with the game itself, it makes the whole transition from Origin to Steam worthless. Before that you only have 1 DRM, with this type of management, now you have 2 DRMs. What you install is another light version of Origin to verify the game one more time before starting it. Good job EA, beside the profits reason, I don't even know what is the purpose of bringing it onto Steam anyway. Take Microsoft games as an example, where they brought most of their top-tier games onto Steam without asking you to install the Xbox app. TL; DR:Good game, excellent handling, good customization, okay optimization, decent story, not too much of replayability, bad Origin.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2121336457https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2122787071",Recommended

																BUY IT IF - You're a NFS Fan and crave that latest gen graphics enabled ""need for speed"" experience, dont give a damn about the storyline and want that high speed arcade-ish racing experience.DON'T BUY IT IF - You're looking for a long and engaging storyline, memorable characters (the likes of NFS MW 2005, Carbon) and a game with realistic car handling.WANT TO READ THE WHOLE SHEBANG? THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME.GRAPHICSAlthough the game was plagued with numerous performance issues, fps drops and sudden stutters around its launch time, EA has since then done a good done optimising it for PCs and you should be able to enjoy the game stutter free now if you have a decent rig. The graphics obviously are good and on par with most racing games of this generation. The game looks even better at night with the frostbite engine taking full advantage  of latest gen hardware and showing some truly phenomenal lighting, specular and particle effects (try to run it at least on high to enjoy it fully). A graphical powerhouse as expected from EA.GAMEPLAYPeople who have been playing the last few NFS games would be easily familiar with the car handling, EA hasn't changed much in the frostbite engine in terms of vehicle handling and although it is very different to the old vehicle handling of the NFS Underground, MW and Carbon era, it is intuitive and easy to learn for newbies. Emphasis has been placed on usage of the Handbrake (E-brake), with most top end fast cars requiring you to tap the e-brake to quickly turn into sharp corners. What impressed me the most was the off-road handling which was smooth and fun. The cop system is highly impressive, the cop cars are formidable at higher heat levels which adds a nice challenge to the races.  People looking for realistic handling experience like Forza, BACK OFF !BOTTOM LINEAll in all, an arcade-ish fast paced racing game with good graphics and a mediocre, borderline boring and rather short storyline. The multiplayer is kinda fun i.e. racing with your friends. There is quite a collection of cars which will keep you entertained suitably long enough. A worthwhile buy if you snag it during a sale.",Recommended

																Need for Speed Heat is the latest, non-remake Need for Speed game, and as someone who used to play a lot of Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit and Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005), without touching other NFS games until recently, I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by this game.Its premise, to begin with, grabbed my attention. I'm not talking about the story itself (will get on that later), but rather the game's main ""gimmick"", for lack of a better word. Before moving forward with the review, I'll ask you bear with me; as I said in the opening paragraph, the last NFS game I truly played was Most Wanted 2005, so if things in this game were already done in previous entries, I'm unaware of them. Anyway, onto the gimmick!The game is set in a rather large open world, consisting of Palm City (think Miami) and its surrounding areas, and gameplay is divided between Day and Night. There's no actual day/night cycle, rather, when leaving your garage, you can choose whether to leave during the day or night (also, during the day you can then switch to the night, but can't go back to the day without reaching the garage first). At day, you can participate in legal races, to earn bank (i.e., cash) to buy new cars or parts to improve your car. At night, in traditional NFS fashion, it's time for high-speed illegal races, which might draw the attention of the cops; in these races, rather than earning bank, you earn ""Rep""; think of it as experience points to level up your character, unlocking more powerful parts and cars. Of course, if you get caught by the cops, you lose whichever amount of Rep you earned, plus a good chunk of cash as a fine.Besides the main racing aspect, the game also offers many different side activities; heck, even the races themselves have variations, since you can also participate in off-road races, though you'll need to tune your car in order to have any chance at winning them (believe, a car tuned to race on the street will not go far in an off-road race). Besides that, there's also Drift races and Drift zones, which are basically the same thing: drift to earn points. There's also speed traps, long jumps, and a whole bunch of collectibles.The game's online mode plays in the same world as the solo mode, you simply pick whichever mode you want, with the main difference being the presence of other players, who you can challenge in the many events the game has. If you go into a story mission, however, it'll be as if you were playing solo (though in that case, you should be doing the story offline, and play online when you wanna compete with other people). You can also form ""Crews"", which are groups of up to 32 people that provide certain bonuses as the group's level increases.Now, this review has gone on for too long, and I haven’t even got to the story. As you’d expect from a game about street racers, it’s about a crew being pretty much dismantled after the cops bust one of its members. You arrive in the city as a new guy trying to make a name for himself, and suddenly get involved with this crew, while discovering the corruption behind Palm City’s police department. It’s a pretty decent story, all things considered, and as a fan of Most Wanted 2005, the final mission gave me a nice surprise.Visually speaking, the game is superb, it has some pretty detailed graphics, and the cars look fantastic. Which is something I forgot to mention: the cars. This game has a lot of cars, including classics from old NFS games; my favourite car, the Lamborghini Diablo SV, is in the game, as well as other cars you might recognize from previous games. And when in comes to customization, there’s plenty: not only can you upgrade your cars by switching parts, but you can also change their appearance, and your avatar’s appearance, with dozens upon dozens of customization options.Honestly, I could keep writing about this game all day; I haven’t even mentioned the soundtrack (which is good, including many tracks that play as you drive around), but this review is getting long enough as it is. All I can say to conclude is that this game has rekindled my love for Need for Speed, and thus I can easily recommend it.",Recommended

Need for Speed™ Heat ,"Posted: 27 December, 2020
																Pros:-It's fun-Cars sound mean and are fun to drive-Less arcadey car handling feel than the previous 2 NFS installments (but still pretty arcadey)-Game manages to hit somewhat close to the glory days of Underground and Underground 2Cons:-The characters, of which you must choose one, all look/act like a bunch of dorks-The soundtrack is garbage-The visuals aren't as good as NFS 2015 (which was probably the best-looking NFS game to date)-The storyline is cheesy-No real gritty, underground type of feel. I used to partake in underground street racing in my younger, less-responsible days. You run into some pretty shady, dangerous, and threatening characters. There's none of that here. In this game, everyone (at least so far) comes off as really non-threatening. Everything just feels way too ""safe"" for an underground racing environment.Biggest Con of all:-The police talk like a bunch of corny movie villains over the scanner while they're chasing you. It's hokey and really immersion-breaking. It was so much better in past NFS games where their chatter sounded more or less like real police radio traffic.Despite the flaws, I'm still enjoying it. But it could have been so much better.",Recommended

																TL;DR-Offers 30 hours of decent entertainment. Just don't buy it at full price.\Detailed:EA has been producing Need For Speed games in this weird bubble where they think that are the only racing game that exists. That said, Heat is better than the other NFS games that have preceded it in recent memory.It offers decent entertainment for 30 hours or so, with good enough customisation, alright racing and some multiplayer. They did try to push the MMO aspect of the game, but it seems to fall short, because I only encountered an online lobby with more than 1-2 people once.Taking each aspect of the game one by one:The Campaign Story: It's ok at best. There is nothing stellar about the story, but nothing too bad either. Dialogue is a little too cringe maybe.Cars: There is a decent selection of cars, with some charming oddball cars. However, you will soon find out that you need only approximately 3-4 cars to beat the campaign with ease, so there is no real requirement to diversify your garage. The drift and offroad story lines are lackluster and offer little to no incentive (covered later).Modifications: The modifications are good. There are many real life bodykits and wheels you can choose from, made by actual companies. The wrap editor offers good control and option to customize your paint and decals, and the community wrap section is great if you want to save yoursef the hassle. There are some really nice wraps there.Progression: Continuing from the point above, the campaign can be beaten with 3-4 cars. Money is available very easily, with races 4-6 minutes long paying out very big dollars. However, there are only 3-4 races that offer this. The older races on the map, that unlock as you increase the performance of your car, don't really scale their performance requirement or payout in relation to your current vehicle. Another aspect of progression I find very egregious is the loot at the end of the drift and offroad side-missions-spun-into-a-story. These events require, towards the end, a performance rating of 300-320 out of a maximum of 400, but the rewards for beating these events are around 140. At that point, I have no need to use that prize vehicle ever, as my current vehicle that I modified to beat this style of event is many-fold better than the rewarded car.Another major issue here is the end game activities, or the lack thereof. There is no reason for me to grind out races after finishing the campaign. The night races that unlock at heat 3 and heat 5 have only so much they can offer, and get monotonus after a very short time. Other than that, there is no real end game here.Gameplay: The driving is very arcade, but the game seems to favour drifting than braking and turning as far as going the fastest around a bend is concerned. This almost punishes you for having a car with maximum grip. However, the cars towards the other end at full drift spec will slide if you even breathe on the steering, making them very hard to control. The MMO aspect adds no real value to the game, other than racing against other players.One point I'd like to highlight here is the cops. At lower levels, the cops are so overpowered you will cower in fear. However, once you reach performance 300+, they become so easy to deal with, its not really a challenge. EA has been unable to strike a balance for the cops that feels like it is easy enough for someone learning the ropes, but difficult enough for someone that has spent significant time in the game. The AI drivers in the races are also very lackluster, and seem to be just filling in the spots at the race.Graphics and Sound: The models used for player cars are great and very detailed. The NPC cars however, are not as good. It doesn't really crop up as an issue if youre driving at speed, but deeply affects immersion if you're stationary. The world design is decent, and has a good enough mix of roads to drive on.All in all, this game is decent, but not at full price. If you're spending AAA money, you're better off spending it elsewhere. If you get the game at a discount though, its an alright buy that works good in its isolated environment. Too bad Forza exisits on PC, and got more things right than this.",Recommended

DEATHLOOP,"Posted: 30 September
																Deathloop is absolutely worth your time. Just, maybe on a sale. I think overall, the game is some good ole fashioned fun. But, there are enough caveats that I can't blindly recommend it.I enjoyed this game much more than I was expecting to, due to the discrepancies between reviews online. Deathloop is in no way a 10/10. lol. But, it is a solid 7.5. I would even go so far as to say that to me, it's an 8. There are plenty of interesting things going on in Black Reef. Mysteries that compelled me into a second playthrough. To seek out more of the oddities sprinkled about the island. The exploration and world building pulled me in to Black Reefs nihilistic state of mind. And, mixed with the fun combat, tight controls and lack of consequences, the gameplay loop flowed in a natural, messy way. So quickly, before I really start. I tried multiple ways to express the important bits about this game and, finally, landed on a pros and cons list. Not my usual style, but hopefully it gets the point across. This game is mixed.Pros-Interesting, mysterious world- There is a lot of world building going on in this game. Everywhere you go there are events to discover and manipulate, conversations on which to drop your eaves and many notes and audio logs to increase your knowledge of the loops inhabitants. I really enjoyed just exploring and uncovering secrets.-A good amount of variety in playstyle options with a large amount of trinkets to augment/refine your ""build""- Be a master hacker. A non-stop force wielder. Go up close invisible melee stealth. Or, get some long range, 2 girls one nail stealth action. Dual wield full auto, health leeching smgs. Run around as a rabid (limb)hacker, chopping body parts like a passionate butcher. Or, you could just spend your day teleport kicking eternalists into walls and off cliffs. It's all visceral and cathartic.-Engaging cast of characters with a lot of notes/audio logs to build their personalities- They're engaging in the way that I was always excited to get more info on who the Visionaries were, outside of moving the story forward.-Great soundtrack-Fun to see how each area changes during the course of the day-Infusion mechanic- Cool rogue-like element that allows you to slowly build an arsenal that you keep through every loop.-Side quests worth completing for particular weapons and trinkets that you won't find elsewhere.-Game gives direction, but not too much- Yes, you have an objective marker that updates, but often you have to actually look around to find information, items or your targets.-Good options for HUD/immersion- I truly appreciate these options. The game can give all the pertinent information to you upfront. Selected weapons/powers, health/mana bars, discovered information, objective markers. Or, You can turn all that clutter off . . . Say you turn off the option to notify you of important discovered info. Well then, when you read a note or hear a conversation you actually have to pay attention to how you can best utilize this discovery.-Secrets that you actually have to find and solve without the use of the menu or objective markers. I only found a handful of these while I explored the island, but they require the use of an actual brain(or the internet).Cons-Plenty of unsolved or unsatisfying endings- It felt like a lot of questlines didn't have a satisfactory conclusion. Just a special trinket or weapon(which is fine). But, nothing really cool or bombastic. The campaign endings were all equally vapid. Also, why can most people here not remember the days going by? That was never explained and it bothered me.-The low number of powers, and creativity of the Slabs are disappointing- They can be used in interesting and engaging ways, but they are all rather uninspired. Basic.  -Shift and double jump feel necessary for traversing the world, limiting power and trinket options- These two are by no means mandatory. You can finish the story and probably even solve most of the mysteries of Black Reef without them. The level design supports this. But, you will most likely feel hindered by their absence. This is especially egregious to your powers. Because having shift limits you to one slab. Shift should have been a dedicated Slab like Reprise is. But, this would add another button to an already crowded control scheme.-The best characters(Colt and Julianna)are underutilized/not fleshed out quite enough- This is particularly apparent with Julianna. As, even though you speak with her throughout the entire game, she has criminally little screen time. Their banter throughout the game is well done though and often funny. Lending much to their relationship.-Most of the story is told through indirect means- This point and the one above make the actual story, essentially non-existent. Honestly, damn near everything is left to notes and audio logs.-The main story is linear. Not many rogue-like elements- You can kill the main targets with a machete, a bullet or even a swift quick in the butt. There is one path to breaking the loop though. All the npcs have the same scripts during each time period. Everything is static. Makes it easy to learn each area and time, but probably leaves less room for emergent gameplay.-Dumb AI/easy combat- Self-explanatory. But, the enemies you kill DO leave something behind, signaling to other npcs that someone has died. They are still dumb about it of course.Some other things to consider.-The Julianna invasions are a cool foible that add a tense game of cat and mouse into what is a generally easy game. You have the options to play with an AI invader, randoms online or just people on your friends list. Because of my poor connection though, I was forced into playing with the computer driven assassin. Which greatly lessened the intensity of these encounters, because her AI is just as bad as the rest of the npcs. Sometimes she gave me trouble or even killed me but, majority of the time she was just a nuisance. This is a, somewhat needed layer of lethality the game can benefit from. Unfortunately, I was not able to experience it fully. -If you stick to the story, the game could probably be beaten in 10-12 hours. But, if you explore and dedicate some of your loops to solving puzzles and witnessing events, it could take upwards of 20. My 70 (Steam)hours feels slightly exaggerated(there was some time spent idle). But I definitely played at least 60 hours between two campaigns.-Performance was mostly fine. No micro-stuttering or crashes after the patches. My entire second playthrough was free of them. But, I did see frame drops in some areas here and there. Even while locked at 60. Not that often though. Also, my Vram usage was above the limit even on very low. I played with most settings on high and it was fine. But, those who are demanding high frames and no drops may want to consider this.-PvP- From what I've read the servers are peer to peer. And from my experiences playing as Julianna this, really ♥♥♥ sucks. My internet is SHT. The few games I got to play online were filled with balance breaking lag. That's if I even connected. Regardless, I had fun controlling the invader. It seems like there is a decent progression system in place here and incentive to get creative with your violence. I had a lot of fun with my limited online interactions. Seriously. I wish I could have put more time in this mode.I had a lot of fun with Deathloop. But the old adage seems to hold true; wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle.",Recommended

DEATHLOOP,"Posted: 11 October
																Deathloop seems like it was made for a specific audience. Most of the reviews complain about the maps being small, game being repetitive etc, and I can understand people finding it somewhat repetitive, however, at it's core, if you use leads properly, explore the maps throughly and put together clues, ever single loop is different. The amount of detail that's been put into the games' main mechanic - the loop- is insane. Not only can you influence the entire day by making changes in the world, but you start feeling like you're mastering this extremely adverse situation you're in, piecing together what steps you need to take to end the game. Adding to the detail, the environments are choke full of different environmental storytelling. The game keeps you guessing at what's going on, which I really enjoy. There aren't that many weapons, but being only able to carry 3 means that once you get a loadout you enjoy, you won't change it that much. That said, there is a lot of different things you can do with weapon and character mods. Main character mods also change a lot, since there are some purple rarity mods that can change the way you play entirely, for example, being able to breathe gas or push people while sprinting.As for the powers, I've heard people complain about only using blink and aether (invisibility) since they're the most useful. I strongly disagree, Nexus makes for fantastic take downs, Havoc can let you change the way you play and go for a melee-centric build, Karnesis is, by far, my favorite power. Being able to control where you throw enemies by subtle mouse movements takes getting used to, but it is absolutely devastating when used properly. You can completely shut down a Julianna or a Colt by changing their position, also leaving them exposed or killing them mid air, throw them off the map, or smashing them against a wall.Colt and Julianna's banter and relationship is extremely well written too. The visionaries all also have their own personalities even though some get way more screen time than others (Aleksis being the prime example, however fitting it is)Performance is still an issue, there's no doubt about it, but it seems to be being worked on.This game certainly isn't for everyone. It's made for certain type of players, but that isn't inherently a bad thing. Perhaps the marketing could have been more specific. I still haven't finished the game, but I am enjoying it a lot.EDIT:I have finished the game once, it's very satisfying to finally solve the puzzle, but the ending does feel too abrupt. I will try and 100% the game though, the loops are fun themselves.",Recommended

																I want to preface this review by saying a few things, because I think the context of my disappointment is important here. I love Arkane's work. Dishonored and its story DLC is arguably my favourite stealth/immersive sim game and I always find myself replaying it. I don't adore Dishonored 2/DOTO nearly as much, but still think they're enjoyable experiences in their own right. Prey is fantastic, criminally overlooked, and its DLC, Mooncrash, is possibly even better. It seemed like this game was meant to be the idea of Mooncrash expanded into a full-blown experience. The end result is a game that's *fine*, but far from Arkane's best work IMO.The concept is cool, but the story and characters end up being just ok. Colt is an entertaining protagonist, but not a whole lot is done with Juliana and a lot of the stuff with her, particularly her relationship with Colt and the loop, falls flat due to the lack of character development/screen time. I also think the three possible endings are all pretty lacklustre, but I doubt narrative is the reason people play Arkane games.Investigating the eight visionaries and planning a route where you can assassinate all of them to break the loop sounds like a neat concept, but is botched where it counts. Investigating is largely non-linear, suffers from a bit of hand-holding, but is ultimately satisfying. The problem, is that there's only one route you can take to break the loop. Certain visionaries have to be killed in certain places, and at certain times, which kills a lot of potential replay value. There's also no option to go non-lethal with these guys, which I'm sure most won't take issue with, but it's definitely worth mentioning. I know that the idea of violence and murder is core to the theme and narrative but I think a lot of people play these games for player choice.Speaking of player choice, there's an okay amount of it here, but its extremely lacking in comparison to games like Prey and Dishonored. The biggest offender is that you can only have two of the five powers equipped at any given time, and you can't change this until you move to another district. I'd argue that most players will have Shift on most of the time for traversal's sake, meaning you only have one slot for whichever power you want. Additionally, none of these powers are particularly unique or new. Karnesis is similar to Windblast, just with directional inputs. Nexus works like Domino, just as an AoE projectile now, Shift is Blink, Aether makes you invisible, and Havoc has you deal more damage and take less. For a game that encourages you to 'play your way' it feels needlessly restrictive and watered down because of the lack of unique powers and equipment.There are some things the game does well, like the Infusion system which allows you to bind items to Colt cross-loop. You really have to think about what to spend your Residuum on between runs, which makes for some great delineation of what to keep and what to chuck Player controlled Juliana invasions are great, incredibly tense and arguably the best part of the game when it works. The initial groove of building up an arsenal of powers and weapons has a strong sense of progression, and you really feel like you learn about the loop alongside Colt. Gun-play feels great overall,  weapons are fun to play around with, great soundtrack, sense of style, and theme. Random thoughts- Weapon rarity feels half-baked and pointless- Opening hours/tutorial sections are boring- Districts seem big at first, but are quite small, and lacking content- AI is way too easy for a game like this, and lacks difficulty optionsI think that this game will do wonders for some, and I'm glad that they can enjoy it for what it is. I think if you haven't played Mooncrash, the novelty and concept of the loop will carry a lot of the experience. For me, this just didn't hit, and I'm disappointed because I was really excited for it. I don't think it's bad per se, but not worth it at full price, especially given its technical state which I won't comment on, there's enough of that around already. It's a perfectly fine game, but if you like Arkane game's for their depth, replay value, and player choice, you might want to hold off on ""DEATHLOOP"" until it's a bit cheaper.EDITI know it's not a Dishonored sequel, and I wasn't trying to review it as such. This review also isn't meant to be comprehensive. I wanted to get my thoughts out there because I think a lot of people will go into it expecting an incredible experience - which some people will get - but others who expect more depth from Arkane games I think are going to be disappointed. I think it's important to provide an alternate perspective on it, because I see almost no one talking about this game's design flaws. Narratively speaking, Juliana isn't half the game, and Protect the Loop, isn't half of the gameplay experience. It's an additional mode, that has some replay value, but it's not like it's a whole second campaign or something. My gripes still stand. I did play some Protect the Loop and I think it's fun when it works, but if people come to ""DEATHLOOP"" expecting more Arkane excellence along the lines of Prey and Dishonored, Protect the Loop won't give it to them, and I don't think Break the Loop does much better. If anything, I always saw this game as a spiritual successor to Mooncrash. As I said in my review, it's clear to anyone who's played Mooncrash that this is a VERY similar experience. If you liked it more, that's awesome, and I'm so glad you did, but I didn't and wanted to point out why, because I doubt I'd be alone in thinking this. My gripes would still stand even if Dishonored and Prey didn't exist, because I do think the game is needlessly restrictive and relatively surface level. The game has so much potential but fails to capitalise on a lot of it in my personal opinion. I think this would still be true if the game was Arkane's first title. I really do believe that this game would be a MUCH better experience for someone who hasn't played Mooncrash before, because ""DEATHLOOP"" is shallow in comparison. Sure, it offers a different style and overall feel, and the concept is great, I just think the execution is a bit botched, and I don't think its unreasonable to assume that this game is taking the concept of Mooncrash, building on it, and expanding it. Lastly, if you feel the need to suggest that my thoughts on any game are uneducated or uninformed, just don't comment unless it's constructive. I did play half of the game, just because I didn't enjoy it as much as you did, doesn't mean I didn't play it, lol. I'm not going to come after you because you enjoyed a game that I didn't, the inverse should also be true.",Not Recommended

																I waited until I had at least 1000 hours on PC to write this review. Honestly there's so much to say about this game. Been a fan of the series ever since Tri, and I sank 800 hours into MHGU (which you can now buy on switch, which is dope).Let's start with the cons because I think it's more important to see if the cons are worth looking past if you're on the fence about buying.Cons:- weapon designs are less creative than older titles. Everyone knows that this game is notorious for taking a bland weapon design, slapping on a few monster parts, then calling it a day rather than creating a new design that creatively incorporates the actual design of the monster it's made from. HOWEVER, lots of the newest endgame weapons that were introduced in the Iceborne expansion are more creative and look fantastic. With the addition of layered weapons, this is less of a problem since you can make a bland weapon look like an endgame weapon or at least have it match your outfit- monster list is less diverse than older titles. Let's make a comparison between MHW and MHGU. With the addition of Iceborne, there are 68 large monsters to fight vs 93 large monsters in MHGU. However, in MHW, about 5 of these monsters are either tied to limited events or are not really noteworthy (zorah is pretty boring imo). So that leaves around 63 monsters. 5 more monsters are tied to the late game where you have to rank up enough to grind and unlock them. So that leaves you with around 58 monsters for at least the first 300 hours of the game. MHGU gives you 93 monsters that unlock as you naturally progress through the game, with 18 of those monsters being deviant versions that can progress alongside your hunter rank so that they scale into late game with proper rewards once you get there. Additionally, the monster diversity in MHGU is a lot higher. There's giant frogs, big mammoths, more monkeys, giant crabs, giant snakes, giant spiders, etc. Keep in mind, a lot of the monsters in MHW are ALSO in MHGU, whereas the opposite is not true. Iceborne helped to alleviate the diversity in MHW, but not nearly to the degree of it solving the problem.- it's a MH game, so grinding is a huge part of the game. This point is mainly for people who've never played the series. MH is a grind. To get better weapons and armor, you have to farm the monster enough times until it finally drops the parts that you need. Then you need to grind it again for the armor. And if you want other armors or weapons, you have to grind those too. With the addition of Iceborne, if you want to unlock the true endgame content, you need to grind your rank and farm the correct monsters to unlock the other monsters. Then you need to make sure you have enough supplies so that you can craft enough ammo/potions/etc. Grind, grind, grind. If you are not a fan of repetition, this is NOT the game for you. If you're a veteran of the series, this point should basically be meaningless. Why do you think I have 1000+ hours and I'm still playing?One thing that I think is more of a misunderstanding or neutral point is the gameplay difficulty. In the old games, G rank hunts were more dangerous compared to Master rank hunts in Iceborne. There are a lot of factors regarding the difficulty which people tend to either overlook or disregard. In the old games, monster animations were a lot less telegraphed. Some attacks would happen with very little warning visually, and sometimes you had to guess which move would come out. Healing was different because you ate a potion, then stood around and flexed for 5 seconds with nothing to do except wait for the animation to finish. Skill trees were harder to customize because you had to hit a certain threshold of skill points before the skill would even activate. Not to mention armor parts had less slots for your decorations. Monster attacks did much more damage because there were less upgrades available to your armor. Combine all of these together and you get hunts that were more dangerous because visual cues were less forgiving, you took more damage, had less skills available, and healing made you a sitting duck.In MHW, monster animations are much more telegraphed, which is much more fair imo. It makes more sense that you can see a monster wind up to perform a strong move instead of the monster standing still for 3 frames, then unleashing a move that could kill you. This means there's less BS moments when it comes to taking damage. If you got hit, chances are you saw it coming but might've been preoccupied with something else. Healing is different because you can now drink a potion while moving instead of standing around and waiting for the animation to finish. Again, this is another QOL improvement that makes more sense and leaves less room for BS or blaming the crappy controls. Skills are more easily available because even if you only have a single point in a skill, you can at least gain a minor benefit of that skill. Armor parts have more slots for decorations, so skills are even more accessible. Finally, armor parts have more upgrade levels. This is more just putting 2 and 2 together. If you have more upgrades to your armor, you take less damage.People have complained that MHW is a lot easier than older games, but really they've just fixed a lot of the annoying issues in the old games and given the player more tools at their disposal. If you really want to emulate the difficulty of the older games, don't upgrade your armor so high, don't use the ""meta"" sets, use less decorations so that you have less skills, and stand in 1 spot while you drink your potions. The beauty of this game is that you're not forced to always use the best gear or all of the tools at your disposal. You can choose to make things more difficult for yourself if you want to. But if you use all the best gear and you complain that the game is too easy, then that's a personal issue.If you can look past these issues or if they don't seem that bad, then you have a wealth of positive things to look forward to!- huge QOL improvements over previous games. Mobility, crafting, movesets, loading times, etc. If you're a fan of the series, I think you'll love the changes. Now that a lot of the old crap mechanics are gone, everything feels so much smoother and streamlined. Farming supplies is so much easier, weapon trees and stats are way more clear, item boxes are all over the base instead of a single location, etc.- graphics are beautiful. Everything just looks so good. Honestly not much else to say here. You just have to see it for yourself- gameplay is very satisfying. All the weapons have their own unique playstyles and all of them are viable when you learn how to use them. There's so much to explore when you learn the small nuances of each weapon and learn how certain moves can help position you for success. The game rewards you for learning monster moves, their weaknesses, how to prep for the fight, etc. And when it all comes together, there's something so satisfying about all your hard work paying off. Of course you could just go braindead and wack them until they die, but to each their own.- Plenty of content for months of replayability. As I mentioned, this game is a grind. You grind for armor, weapons, supplies, upgrades, equipment, decorations, etc. Grinding is part of the core gameplay, so once you finish the story, there's still plenty more to work towards- Iceborne is an amazing expansion. It basically doubled the game's content and introduced a real endgame. Weapons got upgraded, movesets were expanded. Everything just got better, and with more monsters to boot. A must have imo.There's so much to explore and grind that it will keep you coming back for more. If you're a fan of the series or are on the fence about the purchase and you can look past the cons, this game is more than worth the purchase. And at the end of the day, you're fighting beasts, dinosaurs, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dragons. What more could you want?",Recommended
Monster Hunter: World,"Posted: 6 June, 2019
Most enjoyable grind everI’m not a fan of coop games and I really hate grinding but the goal of this game is grinding in coop. After seeing lots of positive feedback I decided to jump on this game and I was very pleasantly surprised.For those who don't know what this game is about, it is what the name tells you – a monster hunter game. You hunt monsters, gather resources, craft new gear to hunt stronger monsters to get better gear. That’s it, very simple formula, but gameplay is really amazing.The game has a story mode which purpose is to teach you about everything slowly. Step by step you complete the assignments, unlock better gear and stronger monsters and when you finish the story the real grind begins. The grind is in no way bad in this game. Yes sometimes when you’re short on some common items going to hunt some weak monster could feel like a waste of time, but most of the time you’ll be hunting strong monsters.Hunting is not as simple as it sounds. First you need to track the monster by finding its tracks which could take some time if the monster is completely new for you.There are lots of weapons to choose and you need to learn the weapon you choose because they all are different and can change your play style completely.It plays like an action game where you attack and dodge. But the fun part is different monsters. They have different moves which you need to learn, you need to read their moves and prepare for their attacks. You can’t just run to the monster and mash the attack button to kill it. This tactic would only work on monsters bellow your level. First you need to choose the right gear with right stats for each monster. You need to avoid strong attacks and find a window to hit the monster and use healing items. You can also use other items like traps to capture the monster, but first you need to weaken it. You can cut-off and break various parts of monsters, like cutting off the tail for example. After you finish the monster you can collect its parts and use them on crafting weapons and armor. Oh and one more thing – you can use environment to your advantage, like shooting a huge rock which falls on a monster. Or another monster could wonder into the same place and attack the monster you’re fighting.You also have a little helper called Palico. It’s a cat-like being which helps you in the world. He can do some damage to the monsters or heal you. You can craft armor and weapons for him and make him cute little kitty.Number of monsters is pretty good, but some of them feel very similar to each other. They look similar and their moves are very similar. I wish we had more completely different monsters. I know dragons are fun and cool looking but it’s a game, developers could think of a way to add different monster while not completely breaking the lore. Wouldn’t it be nice to have a bear-like monster which could give you a deathly bear-hug?I love this collaboration with other games like Devil May Cry, Final Fantasy (which lets you turn your Palico into Mog) or Witcher. There’s even a Witcher quest-line and a monster from Witcher universe to fight.From time to time there are events happening which add more variety in quests and craftable gear. They usually are pretty challenging and require teamwork.The game can be played solo or coop. You can play solo but if you’re not very good you’ll have big problems defeating stronger monsters, so you can fire up the SOS flare and wait until someone comes to help you. Or you can jump into someone’s session who’s doing the quest you need and help him thus completing the quest for both of you. Surprisingly playing with random players are pretty good most of the time. But sometimes it’s either too hard to find someone playing a certain quest or people just leave the quest. That’s when you need to message your friends and ask for help.Graphically the game looks pretty good. It’s not something special, I guess it’s running on an old engine, but overall graphics are good looking. Performance on the other hand could be better. It’s not bad, but if you want to have 60fps on max settings you’ll need a powerful PC. The world is well crafted and locations look amazing. Maps are huge and there are lots of things to discover.Monster Hunter World is a wonderful game and I recommend it to anyone who likes action games and it’s a must have for coop lovers. ProsGood graphicsA lot of contentVery challengingA lot of monsters to huntNo p2w crapNice coopConsPerformance could be slightly betterWhile there are a lot of monsters, many of them feel too similar to each otherMy curator page",Recommended

																This game is absolutely fantastic and is a blast with friends.Two things I HIGHLY recommend for all new players.1. DO NOT USE THE DEFENDER SET. This was put in so new players could rush to start Icebourne DLC. But by using this set it will take away from the whole genuine experience (the way the base game was meant to be played). You will miss out on a HUGE part of Monster Hunter's rewarding progression. The crafting, the upgrading, and customizing of equipment and armors. Also, you take away from the challenge of hunting monsters by giving yourself this (Base) endgame set right at the get go.2. ASAP Try all the different weapon sets (before you even start your first mission). Each weapon has a unique playstyle and almost feels like playing a different game. There's many experiences of people who try this game and don't like it, then come back and try a different weapon and absolutely love the game (me included).(You can do this by accessing the training area. Go to your room, talk to the Housekeeper palico, and access training. You can change between all 14 different weapon sets in the training area.)---Please upvote this so new players can see this and really be able to enjoy the game.",Recommended

																I'm in my mid 40's so I don't always have a lot of time to play games but Monster Hunter: World has me hooked. Since I only can devote about an hour or so every night I just set a goal of what I want to do such as killing or trapping Anjanath to gather parts for the armor set. It's slow going for me, but I don't mind taking my time because the fights are fantastic and sometimes last 20 minutes or more of pure adrenaline-pulsing bliss where a well-timed Palico heal or quick dodge or a perfectly aimed hit makes you feel like you are actually fighting a real monster and that your own life is really on the line. This game is what I dreamed video games would be when I was a kid in the mid 1980's: it's fun, it's drop-dead gorgeous and runs at a nice buttery-smooth 60fps (on my RTX 2060 and Ryzen 5 2600x with 16GB RAM), and overall it's just insanely fun.",Recommended

																If you ever get bored of the end-game grind, here's a small list of things to do that may make you feel a little happy.1. Try a new weapon. I can't stress this enough! Don't just stick with one weapon, try to learn them all. You'll definitely find something that fits you best, but knowing another weapon makes you want to do hunts again and again. You will get a lot more hours doing this.2. Play with friends, or with randoms. While in most games, playing with randoms can hinder your gaming experience, but that's with all multiplayer games. There are bad apples, but in a coop game, they're not nearly as problematic. When playing with people, you can and will have moments that will highten your experience. Like in Level 6 Kulve Taroth, jumping down and breaking her gold coating on the horns with just one hit while your teammates drop rocks on her tail, while also ruining her precious golden mantle. You can seriously get a good sense of comradery when playing with people. As for friends, do the same thing, but also take on hunts that challenge you. If you find a monster annoying, keep fighting him. Learn his quirks. This game is as much a learning game as it is a fun game. Learn weapons, learn monsters. 3. Go on an expedition and just watch the monsters. Throw on a ghillie mantle to cover your tracks for the more fierce monsters, but explore and capture small creatures you find. This game has fantastic monster behaviours. In the Rotten Vale, I suddenly found myself next to an Odogaron, and I prepared to fight him after he roared, but soon he continued walking away. Following him from a distance, I then found him going about his daily routine, which was scavenging for food to bring back to his den. Every monster has their own quirks out of combat. They're not soulless creatures, which makes the experience even more fun knowing that they are closer to animals than virtual creatures created for slaying. 4. The obvious, ""do all the quests."" Optional quests, other quests. Every quest. Blue completed optional quests do not count, you must make them orange! Do this, and reach HR100 so that you can simulate the final episode of Neon Genesis: Evangelion and just be congratulated by everyone. 5. Finally, make your own builds, use whatever weapons you want. Every weapon is viable in this game. If you like the look of a weapon, use it. It doesn't matter, make it yours. You can use meta weapons and meta builds, and while it may be fun for a while, it may get dull. Do something unique, take chances with your builds and find something that suits you. Vitality decorations mat be useless for someone's build, but it may save the life of a build built around fast regeneration and maximum immortality. That's about it. I'm writing this late at night, so excuse typos. Maybe those things to do will help you out a bit. Maybe it'll squeeze out a few more hours, or maybe it'll conjure a few hundred. Anything and everything you can do to help your end-game grind, find it!",Recommended

Excellent fixes, great work from the developers and community managers - little to no BS, mouse fixes, network fixes, prolonged events, and continued support for those with continued network issues. While a clumsy launch is always best to avoid, the gameplay and response from Capcom to the issues they've caused has been more than acceptable.

One specific set of these  items are called defender items. Right off the bat Capcom gives you top tier weapons. Why? Because they want you to breeze through the early stages of the game and buy the DLC. Im not saying this was a terrible idea. In fact it was a good move for people that wanted to skip early instances of grind. The problem was how they presented it. New players coming into the game  would see that these items had better stats than anything else that they could get their hands on. There was no warning or caution. Even after beating bosses until  late game anything that is craftworthy is still outdone by these defender items. As of  right now im replaying  the game on a new character without the gear and it's  more fun because i actually have to learn attack patterns instead of facetanking and using the same move over and over. (it actually works like that with guardian gear). This is a very minor issue which is why im giving this a good review because it's still a bloody ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good game. And the expansion is massive so use  them to your liking. However you're paying money for the base game too and it shouldn't be spoiled just because you didn't know any better. tldr defender items and guardian gear ruin the novelty of an actual progression system until iceborne. don't use them if you want to enjoy mhw to its fullest.",Recommended

																UPDATE: This review is severially outdated and it will not be correct. Sorry for this inconvience.When I first got my key, I got really exicted, To the point where I've gotten over 400+ Days on a world w/ my friends. Here are some of the basic things you should keep in mind about while playing with your friends.Starting off:Once you start off you have 3 choices or gamemodes to play with your friends, Survival, Wilderness and EndlessSurvival: Basically same twist as if you payed endless just if everyone on the server is Dead, a counter goes down for someone to join (That is alive) or the whole world gets reset with the same generation presets.Wilderness:  When you join the server you spawn in a random location (Sometimes an island if your unlucky) and you need to find your group to set up camp. Once you die or have died you are taken to the change character screen and respawn in a new location with your camera rotated in a different pos and if you look on your map there will be a small circle on where you've last died. Keep in mind you die again that Circle updates to where you last died so try to get back to your stuff without dying.Endless: Ah, my favorite of all the gamemodes. When you join the server you spawn in from a ""Jury-Rigged Portal"" And begin surviving. If you die you become a ghost with the character traits of your character. You can respawn if you haunt one of the following. (Meat Effigy, Life giving amulet, Touch stone, Jury rigged portal and Tale-Tell heart) If you respawn from the ""Jury-Rigged Portal or Tale-Tell heart"" You will lose around 20 MAX Health Points. You can get those lost hit points back from getting a booster shot which requires 3 Papyrus, 2 Healing Salves and 1 Stinger (YES STINGERS FINALLY HAVE A USE)Once you join the server (Depending on the size / max amount of players) You basically play regular Don't Starve, If join a larger server with more people there's a silm chance that you will be able to survive the up coming winter or Night. Which can be difficult depending if PVP is on or not. And Since armor has now been changed to take Less damage i.e Wood Armor = 80% (Reg ds) 60% (Dst) Marble = 95% (Reg Ds) 80% (Dst) Football helm = 80% (Reg dst) 60% (Dst).Characters -Wilson:Pros -Grows a beardCons - None.Wilson is a character that i'm pretty sure everyone is going to see ALOT of since he's the first character and Really has no Downfalls even though it takes 19 days for Wilson to get his Homeless man beard it will protect you in winter.Willow:Pros -Doesn't Take fire damageStarts with a lighter (Infinte torch)Cons -When on low sanity Will cause lots of forest firesCan Grief other players Flamable walls / Crops.Willow is a good character for surviving the Winter and helping out your friends in DST. But she can be used to be the most annoying person in the entire server. She can run around starting massive forest fires and buring down vauable resources as well as causing LOTS of lag.Wolfgang:Pros -Gets stronger on a full stomachHas more hpCons - 1.5x the faster Hunger drain at full stomachMoves and deals less damage at a smaller stomachLoses more sanity in Night / AfternoonAh, Wolfgang more of a fighter than a gardener. Wolfgang can be useful for tanking spiders nest and killing of those annoying Tall birds and getting there eggs the only downfall is If you have a lot of food toghether It's not going to last very long amongest 6 Players, If you are playing as wolf gang only ""Power up"" to full stomach when in need. Don't just waste food to be a full stomache because food WILL be eaten fast.Wendy:Pros -Has a ghost sisterDoesn't lose much sanity in darkCons -Does -.25% Less damage than all charactersLoses 50 Sanity when spawning abigail inWendy is one of my personal favorite characters just to add a little challange to the game. Even though she doesn't hit hard she losses NO Sanity in the Afternoon. As well she can spawn her sister in after 2 - 4 Days by killing ANY Animal / Creature Near the flower. She will lose 50 sanity for spawning he in even if another player kills something near the flower. But the fun part is Abigail does Splash damage to mobs near her. If you need to fight something send abigail (or your friends) to kill it. If abilgail dies go pick her flower up, If you can't find it theres a minimap icon for it.WX78:Pros - Can eat ANY Food that is spoiled /  Stale and take no penalty.Can be charged by lightningCan eat gears to level up (Max 400 hp, 200 Hunger, 300 Sanity) Also gears give health, hunger and sanity back if eaten.Cons -Takes Damage in the rainStarts with low stats (100 hp, 100 hunger, 100 Sanity)WX78 Is a good character if you can get to a supply of gears fast as well your going to need to hunt down a pig village for an umbrella. If you don't get an umbrealla right off the bat you will loss 0.25 of 1 Hp every 3 - 5 Seconds. If your lucky enough and you make an umbrealla you won't have the chance of being struck by lightning which will cause you too lose 33 Sanity but Not freeze during winter and can glow like a torch the effect only lasts for one day so don't be adventuring in the middle of the night if the Radius of light is shrinking. But can be benifical if you use if effectively.Wickerbottom:Pro -Starts off with all science machine reciepes unlocked.Able to craft her own booksStarts off with 2 Papyrus.Cons -Can't SleepTakes more penalty for eating Spoiled or Stale foodWickerbottom, The walking science machine, You can pretty much help your friends by going right to an achlemy engine instead of wasting the time of making an Science machine. Even though you can't Sleep there are multiple ways of getting your sanity back up. With the abiliy to make your own books  you have the power to instantly grow all crows and Plants, Spawn lots of birds and more for the cost of your sanity. And yes I know this sounds like wickerbottom is a bad character, as long as you know how to get sanity back without murdering the flower population.The Rest of the characters have no been added while writing this review.Over all this is a great game and I recommend it to any and all players.EDIT: YOU DON'T NEED DON'T STARVE TO PLAY THIS YOU JUST NEED A DON'T STARVE TOGHETHER KEY.

																I wasted so much time of mine on this game, its literally pain, pain, pain. So, some tips for beginners; Stay away from anything that is dark. When its night time make sure you are nearby a fire.Always carry MIN 12 grass, 12 logs, 20 sticks. and lots of food.Stay away from wes, everyone hates him for a reason, dont try to be ""unique"" Do NOT pick up the carrots until theres 3 days left for winter. Thank me later. If you dont secure your server, some willow main will join and burn your base down. Secure your server ALWAYS. Or kick any willow mains that joins the game. Deerclops usually arrives at 20 something days of winter in the game. When you hear his breath, run out of your base as quickly as possible. Find pig king and chester before day 10. Build your base nearby the pig king. Be aware of pigs if you play as Wortox, Wurt or webber. Do NOT stay in the base ALL THE TIME. Ofcourse you will die of starvation if you stay there! Dont be scared to explore, make mini bases in every biom you discover. Make a science machine, speed craft Backpack and spear. Then tore down the machine with a hammer. It will boost you before you settle down with the main base. And please, be cooperative with your friends. Don't be scared to use mods, i recommend Display Attack Range, Wormhole Marks [DST], Increased Stack Size, Ad Shovel, Craft Pot, Camera Tweaks, Boss Indicators, Finder, Global Positions, Minimap HUD, Display Food Values, Show me (origin) and Combined Status.Have fun!",Recommended

Tales of Arise,"Posted: 19 September
This will be completely spoiler free.I have completed Tales Of Arise (PC) yesterday after playing around 80 hours on moderate difficulty, I have done most subquests and I wanted to share my thoughts on this game. I have also posted this same review on Reddit. Many people here in the Steam reviews have barely played the game to give any valid opinions about the game, so here we go.I have completed 6 Tales Of games before, multiple Final Fantasy games, Xenogears, Chrono Trigger, Ys and many others. I am not going to compare games or rank them. I want to share my thoughts about this game that might be interesting for others whether or not to buy this game.First impression: It was very good. After playing the old games, the very first moment you start this game it was a big wow for me. Unreal Engine on a Tales game? Everything looks amazing, fun battle mechanics, interesting story to start with. Absolutely amazing.Story: After finishing the game, I think the story was ""ok"". It is not great but it is also not bad. I think the story definitely had a lot of potential, however the second half of the game managed to lower my initial impression on this game. I don't want to go into specifics or spoiler territory. They had great ideas for the story at the start, but in the end it felt like a missed chance in terms of story writing and execution for me.Graphics: Not much to say, it looks very good. Nice looking environments. Nice looking skits and anime cutscenes. For a Tales game, it is absolutely amazing.Music: It is good but sometimes it was too much. I am not sure how to describe it. At certain parts it sounded too ""epic"" than it should be. Overall I think it was okay, not that big of a deal.Exploration: They have quest markers in the mini map, it is very clear where to go and what to do. NPCs also have the checkmark above their head to indicate that you have already talked to them before. There is the fast travel/waypoint system so you don't have to walk. The game really rewards you to do exploration for good gear and items. I managed to get some very awesome items by exploring as much as I could in each map. The game also has an interesting cooking system that gives a lot of good buffs and a campfire to restore HP/CP. Fishing was also a fun activity to do while exploring the maps. For me, exploration was very well done!Quests: Doing the side quests gave very good rewards and did not feel like a chore to me. The biggest problem that I have is that there was no recommended level for the side quests. It happens very often that you are lets say lv 20. The side quests tells you to kill an elite monster, and it turns out this monster is lv 30+, which is basically impossible for you to complete right now. In my opinion a recommended level would be very much appreciated here... Overall the questing is fun, has good rewards, but the system has some flaws.Battle: It was fun to battle at the start. There are many things you can do in the battle and I like that. There is not really a second where you have to wait for more action. Some boss fights were also fun and challenging for me to do on moderate difficulty. The biggest flaw that I have with the battle system is about the AI. There is no way to control which monster your AI party members will attack. This basically made the battle less fun and borderline annoying, especially in the second half of the game where the monster HP was a lot higher at moderate difficulty. Instead of you deciding how you battle, I had to look at which monster my party member was attacking and attack the same monster. The biggest problem is when the HP pools of certain monsters were very high and they push you against 3 elite monsters, and because of the lack of control over your party members, this made the fights more difficult than it should be. Also they could die easily when facing big attacks from bosses. If I could at least control that they attack the same monster, this would have been a much better experience for me! Overall this felt like a missed chance. Great idea, fun battle system but just this small thing of having no control will be annoying for many players, especially at difficulties higher than normal.Dungeons: Very small puzzles and easily doable without using a walkthrough. I think it was fun to explore all the rooms to get good items and gear. And also to retrieve key items to proceed within the dungeons. Yes some monsters are some reskins, and for me it was not that big of a deal, just a minor thing. However, the biggest flaw for me, is that at some moments they decide to disable the fast travel, so that you have to walk all the way back. And of course the big HP pools elites have returned...DLC/ads: I see a lot of complaints from people. Personally, a little bit of advertising on the right side during a campfire was not a big deal to me. I did not feel forced to buy any DLC, nor did I need DLC to get money in the game. The game is perfectly playable without buying ANY DLC. Sure there are some people that think it is absolutely unforgivable to have any kind of DLC or advertisement, however I don't want to have any discussion about this. It is as it is. I believe for many players it won't be that big of a deal, but if it is for you, then now you know that there are ads and DLC in this game!Final thoughts: I have enjoyed my 80 hours in this game. I am happy with my pre-order on the standard edition and I have got enough hours of enjoyment from this game. If I have to give it a grade, it would be either a 7.5 or 8 depending on my mood and how much weight I place in certain aspects :)Overall I think it is a good and fun game to play, but it has some flaws that diminish the initial first impression.",Recommended

																imagine a AAA-RPG game in 2021 w/o game breaking bugs.only problem i have with this game is the monetization aka MTX, you can buy Gald, boost items, straight up level ups etc, i personally do not care if a game has those buyable options or not HOWEVER when you constantly get it shoved in your face it's suuuuper annoying, start up the game, ! symbol on the main menu, leading to... yes the steam store, if this would be the only encounter i'd still be fine with it but it isn't, rest on bonfires and you have yet another icon with the ! symbol trying to get you to buy any of the boosters or outfits or whatnot.generally speaking this game is fantastic, soundtrack, graphics, VAs, cutscenes etc. however the MTX ads in the game that remind me more of the ""hey click this"" approach of mobile games is horrible, should have kept it in the main menu but keep it out of my actual gameplay.",Recommended

																This review was written after the game was 100% completed and does not contain any heavy story-related spoilers.It feels like Tales of Arise finally got that budget Zestiria and Berseria were lacking. Arise no longer targets PS3 as its main platform, so the overall presentation is mind-blowingly miles away from its predecessors. I'm familiar with all PS1 and PC Tales Of titles, along with recent BANDAI NAMCO action jRPGs like SCARLET NEXUS and CODE VEIN.Good StuffAn excellent title for those that have never touched the franchise. The game explains all the mechanics and there are no mind-numbing complex systems to ruin your experience. Most of the titles are stand-alone in terms of story, so you won't be spoiling yourself.The visuals are heavily stylized, the game was advertised to have an ""Atmospheric Shader"" and I would say that along with image sharpening the results are impressive! All areas of the game have respectable backdrops that are often screenshot worthy.Gone are the days of running around in 10 reskins of same-looking modular caves! All areas of the game feel like they were hand-crafted, and this level of quality persists throughout most of the game. Previous games suffered badly from the dungeon design cheapness, and that feeling persisted throughout the whole journey.Combat is polished and feels smooth. The more story is progressed, the more mechanics are unlocked, so I wouldn't recommend grinding in the same spot. Since the mechanics are unlocked gradually, the player gets enough breathing room to practice. Each main party member can be controlled at any time, so you can pick your favourite fighting style.Hard difficulty does not (un)intentionally punish the player. Berseria had issues with Odorless Fluid. Both Zestiria and Berseria decrease EXP gain the higher your difficulty is set, needlessly prolonging the grind. Arise does 180° and keeps the battles intense, while not making progress tedious. I've played the game from the beginning till the end on the highest available NG difficulty, which would be ""Hard"". ""Chaos"" can be unlocked by the time you're at the end of the story.Post-End Game content is short, but sweet. If you have a history with the series, then you'll likely be positively surprised, as the levels of fan-service are rather high. I actually liked it more than the final areas of the story. Once you finish the story, two sub-quests will appear. It's the one that is located in the earlier part of the game.Sub-quest are designed to be completed alongside the story. They're not annoying, and the rewards are worth it, therefore the quests themselves do not feel like a pointless chore for completion (looking at you SCARLET NEXUS).Pressing select during a battle will bring up a menu where you can quit to the main menu. Not an ideal solution, but still a gigantic QoL improvement for those that like to perfect their boss battles.Neutral StuffComposed soundtrack is completely orchestral. Most of the themes do not overstay their welcome and are evenly distributed across the whole game. They do repeat, but not too often. The soundtrack does fit the general atmosphere of the game, but after two weeks of not playing the game I could not recall a single melody, except the licensed opening theme. I hate to admit it, but the main game's soundtrack misses the mark of being memorable. SCARLET NEXUS was the surprise title of this year that did a better job at having memorable tracks, something that I can call an example of a more old school ""video game soundtrack"" approach. With all of this in mind, I do not dislike Tales of Arise's soundtrack and I do find it engaging. Some tracks gave me FROM SOFTWARE vibes, with epic orchestral compositions and dramatic chanting. It was a grand and unforgettable feeling. Favourite track: Theme of Ganath Haros.For once, I didn't find any particular main cast members that I would specifically like. All the characters are quirky, as evident in the skits, but none of them were charming or memorable enough to switch to them and main them.Bad StuffI've played Zestiria and Berseria in online Co-Op, it was a fun and satisfying way of playing the games. I've found out about Arise's lack of Co-Op particularly late, and I was rather disappointed by such decision. I can play Tales Of games solo without any issues, but the series allowed simultaneous character control ever since the first instalment, and that's one of the franchise's signature features. Local co-op might be a very niche feature in jRPG space to begin with, and that's exactly what made these games special. I don't believe for a second that it was impossible to make local co-op work in Arise, even with the SCARLET NEXUS-esque mechanic of calling your teammates for an attack.The fighting AI of your companions can often compromise a fight. Now, I know that dying teammates is nothing new in Tales Of games, but that doesn't mean that it can't be improved! The AI has zero awareness of hazard zones and will stand in a danger zone, trying to perfect dodge through attack instead of just taking one step to avoid it altogether to begin with. AI perfect dodges are not guaranteed and are often failed, so because of this behaviour battles against a formidable foe are like a coin flip: within the same scenario and conditions the party can get wiped out right in the beginning... or survive through almost the whole thing. When the fights turn ugly, the whole combat experience ends up being an AI revival and babysitting simulator.The variety of zeugles (monsters) is low. Cue the funny Lvl.1 MMO character vs Lvl.80 one. The zeugles get a redesign, their level gets bumped up, their attack have a different element to them, but it's still the same thing. This has been a thing in the series, but it especially stands out in Arise. Bosses have variety. Weapon designs have some variety. Yet here were are whacking recoloured crabs.PC Version Specifics:The situation with the whole Steam Input for gamepads has been a train wreck. Shortly after this game's release, Steam Beta was patched to fix the issue, but for some it still persists. To me it looks like the developers tried to have a fancy gamepad support that backfired instead. Having regular XInput and DInput at least as a rollback option would've prevented these issues altogether.The game runs on Unreal Engine 4, so the overall performance is fair. On a GTX 1070 at 1440p, the maxed out game runs at 60 FPS with dips during heavy alpha transparencies like lots of trees or arte effects right in front of the camera.Graphical options are rather bare bones, some settings are stupid: resolution scaling can be changed by increments of 50% instead of something reasonable like 5%. One thing people might point out is that this game has a rather aggressive level of detail management, so you'll likely notice object details popping in.I did not experience a single gameplay crash, however, I did cause one in main menu while hooking OBS Studio. The game saves frequently, so progress loss is unlikely, unless you don't do any occasional manual saves.Conclusion:Tales of Arise's presentation and quality is tight throughout the whole story. It's a title that is suitable for both newcomers and veterans alike. The combat is enjoyable and technical enough to enable players to have fancy combos, while also having fun. The world is gorgeous and the motion captured animations of the characters really help with the immersion. The cast might not be the most distinct in the series, but the game's skit system is well executed. The overall experience makes this one of the best Tales Of titles.Personally, I'd like to see more classic Tales Of games ported to PC and would suggest not to abandon local co-op for the future Tales Of titles.Review copy provided by BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment.",Recommended

																The game itself is amazing so far.BUT the way Bandai Namco sells it is the reason I give this a negative review.If you buy the regular edition for 60 bucks you are locked out of certain active and passive skills that are linked to some of the DLC costumes. This totals to at least 15 unobtainable nodes in the ability matrix (per character). Unless you are willing to pay 30 bucks extra, this is the state of the game you get.I can live without some useless beach outfits, I can live with certain parts being a little grindy, but i don't accept to miss out on build options just because the publisher decides to cut quite important pieces out of a finished game to sell them separately.",Not Recommended

																Great game, but it didn't do everything right. Still, this is likely my favorite from this series.The good:+ The story was captivating and unpredictable most of the time+ New battle mechanics focused on dodging, combos and flashy moves+ I love long games and this one sure is - took me 150 hours to do everything+ Fishing mini game is great: all of the fish are animated and different in size depending on their weight+ Interesting title system to power up your characters+ Cooking system is better than ever+ New mascot is actually awesome (I didn't like Katz)+ All characters have lots of skills, weapons and feel unique to play+ Enemy weak spot mechanic+ Over 300 fully voiced skitsThe bad:- english translation isn't the best, there's a good amount of grammar errors- some areas/parts of the story truly feel either rushed or not nearly expanded upon, compared to the rest- impossible to play as Shionne in the beginning. Why? Because you have Alphen as the only ""tank"" and guess what? On max difficulty he keeps dying. That doesn't happen with Shionne AI for the most part. So you could say, that you are forced to play as Alphen till you get a full party.- the AI itself isn't good at dodging (it's crap compared to Berseria anyway). This WILL be a problem in some boss fights. Good example is Law. Don't be surprised if Law AI will keep dying even if you have ""best gear"" on him. In fact, there is a boss fight in secret endgame dungeon where your AI will just keep dying to the boss over and over, doesn't matter what level they are or what gear they use.- you never end up unlocking a skip-arte-into-dodge skill in a game that is mostly based around dodging.- later in the game, you will always use those special team moves to finish off enemies, it could get pretty old- speaking of getting old, endgame battles can feel daunting. Especially if there's 3 different types of enemies: you need to break armor for one, stop the arte casting of another and stop the dodging of yet another. And somehow the devs were unable to make the AI do at least SOME of that. So what happens is: you target one, use skill, target another, use skill, target another bla bla. And FINALLY you target the enemy that you want to attack. The cycling between each enemy type back and forth is very annoying in this game.- 70 side quests, but most of them require you to gather 5 bear asses- not much endgame content and not a lot of reasons to play NG+- only 156 enemy types. Tales of fans are used to 256 or at least 200+. That and there's a big amount of reskins- mystic artes felt weak damage wise (I understand why, but still...)- AI strategy settings are lackingWhat Tales of Berseria (previous title) did better:- competent AI- respawnable herbs- more fighting, less targeting- strong mystic artes, can wipe all enemies, while those special team moves in Arise, sometimes don't even kill all- less, but better side quests- AI strategy settings are much MUCH better",Recommended

																There are no videos in this FIFA 22 page at the time I'm writing this review, because those new technologies that EA advertised in YouTube videos  (Hypermotion, etc)  are ONLY AVAILABLE IN NEXT-GEN CONSOLES, not in PC. Basically if those videos were in this page, it would be false advertising and you could apply for a refund even after 100hs. That's why they need to make new vids different from the ones they have in YT. Do not trust me, but also don't trust the blissful ignorance of those guys giving the game a thumbs up. We PC players are being charged the same money as console players, but we're getting a watered down old-gen version of FIFA (FIFA 2019 with minor changes, like CR7 in Manchester United, etc). Just look at the the recommended specs and file size of FIFA 22, they are the same specs as the last 3 FIFAs from past years (requires 50GB, 39GB after download, i5 recommended & 8gb of ram). This is not the first time it happens, same thing happened last year with FIFA 21, in PC they launched the game missing features, so it might happen again in FIFA 23, mark my words.  When media outlets asked EA about this, they said & I quote:  we don't want people with low-spec PCs missing the ability to play FIFA 22.  They also said that they weren't interested in adding those missing features in a future patch. IMHO you shouldn't support this copy-paste business at all, but if you still want more reasons:  EA has DISABLED ""Remote Play Together"", so you won't be able to invite your friends & play remotely, instead each one of you will have to pay $60. (Game publishers in Steam have the ability to enable or disable this feature).  This game will be added to Xbox Gamepass (PC) 6 months after launch (April 2022), so why'd you buy it now if you can just get it for $1 in 6 months? (monthly) No cross-play, this means it will take a lot of time to find online matches after some months, so prepare for high ping depending on your region.  EA TRIED to introduce a ""1 machine activation limit""[www.thegamer.com] DRM with FIFA 22, thankfully they reverted it after A LOT OF backlash from their users, they said ""it was an error from Steam"".  Goalkeepers are dumber than before & they can't deal with finesse shots from a far distance, so the gameplay doesn't reward great crosses, passes, etc. Just shoot from a far distance & you'll score. If you're too close you won't. Hitting ""Play"" in Steam launches Origin. Then Origin launches FIFA 22, then FIFA 22 launches a sort of mini-launcher in which you'll have to click ""Play"" again, otherwise the game won't start. Doesn't bother me but it makes me think: Why is it published in Steam, if we'll end up using Origin? Does people just accept these things after throwing $60 for a copy-pasted game that will be purposely outdated after a year? My advice: just get   Xbox Gamepass (PC) only for only $1 dollar (new users only) & it includes EA Play Basic. [www.xbox.com]  This will inmeadiatly give you access to FIFA 21, FIFA 20, and other games like Back 4 blood, etc for a whole month but also access to a 10 hour trial of FIFA 22 as soon as you bought it, plus access to the full game in April 2022. But if you REALLY want to play FIFA 22 so badly, just get EA Play PRO for a single month($15), it gives you UNLIMITED access to FIFA 22 for a whole month & also unlimited access to BATTLEFIELD 2042(plus early access). Just don't spend $60 in this game at all, rather buy EA Play Pro for 1 month to try things out.",Not Recommended

																Okay, so I am just going to use this as a platform to go off on a tangent regarding EA and not actually review the game (because it is the same damn game every year any ways) itself. EA: You are an utter disgrace of a company and I wish you nothing but the worst. The way you have treated FIFA fans on PC is beyond unforgivable. You treat us like second class consumers. Like we are not valid, yet you are more than happy to take our money every single year. And you KNOW you will get our money every year because no matter how much we hate you, you have monopoly on the football genre - PES died completely with eFootball - and at the end of the day, our love and passion for the beautiful game of football is what makes us buy your cr*p product every year. There is NO excuse for us PC gamers to not have next-gen technology. We have far superior hardware than any console - YOU GAVE NEXT-GEN TO GOOGLE STADIA!? - out there and we are more than capable of running the game just fine; your argument of: ""But we found that most FIFA players on PC do not have good enough PCs to run next-gen"" is completely void because the beauty of PC is that you have options! Give us the option to choose. If you have a good enough PC, there is no reason you should not be able to go into the settings and completely max out the graphics with next-gen technology. This argument - excuse rather - is nothing but a lazy cover up. Also, I just want to add the fact that you charge as much as you do for this game and you can not even introduce Brentford's stadium to the game is nothing short of a disgrace and an embarrassment. You did the exact same thing last year with Leeds when they got promoted. Prior to that, you would always add the stadium of the team that got promoted to the Premier League. Now you do not even do that. You make billions every single year exploiting football fans and our love for the sport. Have some shame.

																There are no videos in this FIFA 22 page at the time I'm writing this review, because those new technologies that EA advertised in YouTube videos  (Hypermotion, etc)  are ONLY AVAILABLE IN NEXT-GEN CONSOLES, not in PC. Basically if those videos were in this page, it would be false advertising and you could apply for a refund even after 100hs. That's why they need to make new vids different from the ones they have in YT. Do not trust me, but also don't trust the blissful ignorance of those guys giving the game a thumbs up. We PC players are being charged the same money as console players, but we're getting a watered down old-gen version of FIFA (FIFA 2019 with minor changes, like CR7 in Manchester United, etc). Just look at the the recommended specs and file size of FIFA 22, they are the same specs as the last 3 FIFAs from past years (requires 50GB, 39GB after download, i5 recommended & 8gb of ram). This is not the first time it happens, same thing happened last year with FIFA 21, in PC they launched the game missing features, so it might happen again in FIFA 23, mark my words.  When media outlets asked EA about this, they said & I quote:  we don't want people with low-spec PCs missing the ability to play FIFA 22.  They also said that they weren't interested in adding those missing features in a future patch. IMHO you shouldn't support this copy-paste business at all, but if you still want more reasons:  EA has DISABLED ""Remote Play Together"", so you won't be able to invite your friends & play remotely, instead each one of you will have to pay $60. (Game publishers in Steam have the ability to enable or disable this feature).  This game will be added to Xbox Gamepass (PC) 6 months after launch (April 2022), so why'd you buy it now if you can just get it for $1 in 6 months? (monthly) No cross-play, this means it will take a lot of time to find online matches after some months, so prepare for high ping depending on your region.  EA TRIED to introduce a ""1 machine activation limit""[www.thegamer.com] DRM with FIFA 22, thankfully they reverted it after A LOT OF backlash from their users, they said ""it was an error from Steam"".  Goalkeepers are dumber than before & they can't deal with finesse shots from a far distance, so the gameplay doesn't reward great crosses, passes, etc. Just shoot from a far distance & you'll score. If you're too close you won't. Hitting ""Play"" in Steam launches Origin. Then Origin launches FIFA 22, then FIFA 22 launches a sort of mini-launcher in which you'll have to click ""Play"" again, otherwise the game won't start. Doesn't bother me but it makes me think: Why is it published in Steam, if we'll end up using Origin? Does people just accept these things after throwing $60 for a copy-pasted game that will be purposely outdated after a year? My advice: just get   Xbox Gamepass (PC) only for only $1 dollar (new users only) & it includes EA Play Basic. [www.xbox.com]  This will inmeadiatly give you access to FIFA 21, FIFA 20, and other games like Back 4 blood, etc for a whole month but also access to a 10 hour trial of FIFA 22 as soon as you bought it, plus access to the full game in April 2022. But if you REALLY want to play FIFA 22 so badly, just get EA Play PRO for a single month($15), it gives you UNLIMITED access to FIFA 22 for a whole month & also unlimited access to BATTLEFIELD 2042(plus early access). Just don't spend $60 in this game at all, rather buy EA Play Pro for 1 month to try things out.",Not Recommended

																Okay, so I am just going to use this as a platform to go off on a tangent regarding EA and not actually review the game (because it is the same damn game every year any ways) itself. EA: You are an utter disgrace of a company and I wish you nothing but the worst. The way you have treated FIFA fans on PC is beyond unforgivable. You treat us like second class consumers. Like we are not valid, yet you are more than happy to take our money every single year. And you KNOW you will get our money every year because no matter how much we hate you, you have monopoly on the football genre - PES died completely with eFootball - and at the end of the day, our love and passion for the beautiful game of football is what makes us buy your cr*p product every year. There is NO excuse for us PC gamers to not have next-gen technology. We have far superior hardware than any console - YOU GAVE NEXT-GEN TO GOOGLE STADIA!? - out there and we are more than capable of running the game just fine; your argument of: ""But we found that most FIFA players on PC do not have good enough PCs to run next-gen"" is completely void because the beauty of PC is that you have options! Give us the option to choose. If you have a good enough PC, there is no reason you should not be able to go into the settings and completely max out the graphics with next-gen technology. This argument - excuse rather - is nothing but a lazy cover up. Also, I just want to add the fact that you charge as much as you do for this game and you can not even introduce Brentford's stadium to the game is nothing short of a disgrace and an embarrassment. You did the exact same thing last year with Leeds when they got promoted. Prior to that, you would always add the stadium of the team that got promoted to the Premier League. Now you do not even do that. You make billions every single year exploiting football fans and our love for the sport. Have some shame. To make matters worse, your launch on Steam has been atrocious just like last time. People are paying over 80 dollars or more in local currency for Ultimate Edition and they were not able to play the game until today.

																I like to think I'm a patient person, and I've waited a month to post this negative review. I honestly regret not doing it sooner. I waited because the game is genuinely fun to play, but at this point the issues are a lead weight on the other side of the scale. I can say that with 134 hours, I've gotten my $60 out of this game, but I had to actually ""try"" to get that value. By the time I was totally fed up, I was outside the refund window, so I kept going to get my money’s worth.Pros:1. When the game works, the gameplay is stellar. The blending of shooting and ability use throughout combat works really well. It is also visually entertaining.2. There is a lot of build customization available between your abilities, skill tree, and the mods you select on your gear. There is plenty to tinker with and you should easily be able to find a playstyle that will be fun for you specifically.3. All the classes are at least entertaining to play. Like every game, they aren't perfectly balanced against each other, but all classes can do all activities with varying levels of effort.4. The story kept me engaged. There was clearly a solid effort put into it. Not award winning, but not everything can be. The campaign with all the side quests completed, took me about 30 hours. It would probably have been a lot quicker if I didn’t raise the difficulty every time a new World Tier was unlocked. Between the campaign and the endgame content, I think there is enough here.Cons: This section is going to get salty. This game has so much potential that got blown here.1. The game, even in single player, is ONLINE ONLY. At the time of writing, the store page says that persistent online access is required for the demo, nowhere does it says this for the core game. This decision appears to be the source of much of the game's greatest failings. There has been a running joke since launch that the sign in screen is the greatest boss in the game, because you can't connect to the servers, or you may just have to wait 20 minutes to sign in. Getting disconnected from the servers multiple times a game session have been a constant issue, something I don’t have in any other game online. There is NO EXCUSE FOR THIS BEING AN ISSUE PLAYING SINGLE PLAYER, but we have to always be online for no reason.2. Adjacent to the online only issue, the game is peer to peer, and as usual that has turned out horribly. No matter if I’m playing with randoms online or friends who are in the same town, if you’re not the host, you’re gonna have a bad time. Since not only do you now need to connect with whatever toaster at PCF you need to for single player, but now you have to remain constantly connected to the host player as well. This results in ability cooldowns failing, weapon and armor affixes failing, and of course lag. If I had a nickel for every time I got stuck for 3 seconds after using Gravity Leap, I would have paid off the $60 for this game.3. Major bugs upon bugs. Only the major ones are listed here, these alone should be damning enough that minor bugs shouldn’t matter.3A. I have never played a game that crashes this often. Sometimes it might take a few hours, other times I get 4 crashes in an hour. After a crash the game decides to create a crash data dumb folder on my OS SSD, despite the game being located on my much larger hard drive. I've deleted 10 gb of crash files twice.3B. We had character and stash inventory wipes caused during multiplayer since launch, and it was a continuing issue for weeks. People Can Fly (PCF) deployed a ""fix"", THAT MADE IT ALSO OCCUR IN SINGLE PLAYER. It appears that further wipes have since been stopped, but it took weeks for an actual fix that didn’t make things worse to be deployed. Effected characters are still entirely unplayable. PCF says that this is intentional to prevent further save corruption as they are allegedly working on limited item restoration of effected characters. The game has been out for a month and we are still waiting. Honestly I expect them to say that they actually can't find a way to do that.3C. In the latest update to the game on April 30th, they ""fixed"" a bugged mod that should only apply a massive damage mitigation boost at 30% hp, but instead was actually operating constantly. In doing so, they managed to break damage mitigation FOR THE ENTIRE GAME. No matter how much resist you have, sometimes the damage mitigation has zero effect. And you’re not just getting one shot because mitigation no longer works. there is also supposed to be a hard stop point at 30% hp preventing one shots in general, that no longer works properly either.3D. It is absolutely baffling that the bugs in this game got through quality assurance (QA). At this point I’m thinking players are the official QA for PCF. In the current Reddit thread for the one shot bug, PCF is requesting players answer 20 questions. A similar thread existed for the item wipes. PCF has repeatedly shown that they can’t be bothered to detect and diagnose bugs themselves, and instead players are expected to write an essay for them. Rather than writing the essay PCF wants, I’ve decided to write my essay here as a steam review. It’s fine to ask for help from players, but at the level of help they are asking for, you are no longer a player, you are a play tester and you should be getting paid by PCF, not the other way around.4. The campaign works on a Diablo like Torment system, in Outriders this is the World Tier (WT). There are 12 WT levels that are unlocked as you play the game and your progress to the next level gets partially removed when you die. This is a good system that would be in the pros section in any other game, but PCF shoots themselves in the foot. WT becomes pointless the moment you unlock the expeditions endgame content, because there is a second difficulty scaling system for expeditions only, Challenge Tier (CT). WT gear from campaign max drops at level 42, CT gear max drops at level 50. Now you could spend resources to level up the lower level gear, but there is no incentive to even play WT campaign content because the drop rates of legendary gear is massively lower than in expeditions. This means that instead of spending time doing the 30 hour campaign again, you just do the same 15 expeditions over and over that take 5-20 minutes each at gold medal time. It just arbitrarily limits the content you can do if you want good gear, hurting fun and replay-ability. Said good gear being the entire point of a looter shooter.5. The endgame expedition missions have the same issue as Diablo 3, its timed content. Your worthwhile rewards for the missions are almost entirely dependent on finishing the mission as fast as possible. If you build anything but pure damage, you will not beat these timers. It shoehorns you into glass cannon builds, drastically decreasing the number of viable builds in endgame content. You want to build tank, your just wasting your time.Conclusion: This could have been so much longer, but if by now I haven’t changed your mind, nothing I add is going to change that. PCF, like many of developers as of late, clearly believes that it is alright too officially release a game that I’m not sure should even be considered a beta build. The demo was a more stable experience than the full game. This game has so much potential that has just been squandered. PCF didn’t deserve my money, and they don’t deserve yours either.",Not Recommended

																This has been, honestly, by far the worst release I've ever been apart of. This game lacks everything needed to be complete. Game breaking bugs, lack of Dev support, Dev's not listing to the community in fact they out right blame the community for the games problems. Almost zero updates since release, crashing servers, total char item wipes, empty promises and outright lies.... I find it bizarre as well that this game claims to be trying to create the most immersive co-op experience ever and doesn't implement any sort of communication. That's right ZERO way to talk to the other players.. No Text... No Voice... hell you can't even ping targets. This is truly a single player co-op game. You have 3 playing but all doing their own thing, as well the add friend feature is also not working so forget adding them and trying a third party service.Overall I truly needed write a review seeing as how I spent $80 on something that's just so poorly done. If I can stop one person from getting this pile of junk then its been a review worth writing.** Update ** I totally understand the confusion based around the amount of time I've played and the recommendation to not get the game.I spent a lot of money on the title and, in my own way enjoy the game. I see potential in its current state but I would be hard pressed to think someone else would be as open minded. I mean some of the hate here shows as much.I will continue to play this game as much as long as I wish but I cannot see others enjoying this rocky experience and feel obligated to give my opinion.I still would not recommend this game I hope people spend their money elsewhere. Honestly, best of luck.",Not Recommended

																I like Outriders and the time invested so far can attest to that. But unfortunately I cannot recommend such a bug ridden game to anyone in good conscience. I will not go through the many bugs encountered, as other reviews have done so more eloquently than I could ever do. For me though, two game breaking bugs forced me to stop playing:- The _constant_ disconnections from the server. When I am playing solo, why is there a need for an always ON connection? There is nothing more disheartening than having gone through an expedition and at the last moment you get disconnected without any loot drops or resources to show for it. And it happens A LOT!- Co-op gaming is so buggy, I spent more time trying to connect to friends' games and via versa, rather than actually playing. Often when a connection is established, and a party has formed, a crash to the desktop follows. And today my inventory was wiped clean after such a crash for a good measure.Most of my friends are so fed up and annoyed with Outriders, that stopped playing some time ago, some even mid-campaign. Having lost all my items is a sign that I must move on too and a warning to all that still play this buggy mess, that this could happen to you at any time, so beware.",Not Recommended

																This game has amazing potential. I've played it for over 350 hrs so i think I've earned my right to say my peace. The combat is good when you are not getting one shotThe story is meh if we are really being honest with ourselvesThe endgame is a joke its the same 6 (15 Total) maps that people will grind to get a god roll weapon or piece of armorIt is only a speed run simulator and that for me grows boring quicklyThe world they built is beautiful but its isn't used after the main campaign a real waste in my opinionThe many multiplayer bugs really killed a lot of interest for my friends and I ended up just alone in a game that is forced to be online 24/7This game could be amazing if they 1. Fix the many bugs2. Admit this is a live service game and treat it as such3. Add new content (modes, expedition types, Story DLC)4. Make it so that it is not a chore to get a legendary weapon or armor 5. Make Tiago useful or get rid of him. 6. Remember that not everyone wants to play in a group. 7. Remove the timers from expeditions and make other builds truly viable in solo or teamsI will recommend this game when the majority of the issues get fixed. It isnt worth the $$$ currently",Not Recommended
OUTRIDERS,"Posted: 10 April
																So, I'm trying to revise this review as I've (tried to) play some more of this game a the last few days, a few months post launch.What I originally wrote about the FP and AP scaling in the balance section is not true (anymore?).AP still scales post max character level even if you don't get any AP on your items. In fact certain AP builds outperform the typical FP builds but require legendaries (and their tier 3 mods) to work.But that aside the multiplayer aspect of this game is horrible.Usually the game just crashes either when:- trying to join a lobby of friends- trying to leave any lobby- opening the loot box at the end of an expedition (endgame repeatable mission)- after using a skill such as jumping towards your enemy/friend (like Trickster's Hunt the Prey)- trying to start an expedition- trying to quit the game (not the worst, but forces you to use the task manager to kill it after closing it unless you're content with Outrider's weird memory leaks to eat up your expensive RAM while playing something that works)If you try to join a lobby for expeditions (it gives you the choice between expeditions and campaign), it pairs you with someone trying to finish the campaign. If you leave your lobby open people will (have to) join who have no interest in doing the same thing you want to do in the game. It's incredibly useless.FYI: if you run a lobby with friends and one of them leaves it automatically sets the party to open, allowing the aforementioned things to happen even if you didn't provoke it.---------------------Down here you can read my original review:Background: ex Warframe player looking for an alternative-----The good: Personally I like the storyline. I like sci-fi settings in general so if you aren't a sci-fi fan you might find it somewhat bland. But you still get a sense of mystery since most questions that come up during the storyline will remain unanswered and you will notice that your main character the recurring characters will simply have to learn to deal with that and often drift into a strongly depressive mood over how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ humanity really is. The dubs underline this, there really aren't any high emotions in the way people talk.The combat is overall enjoyable. A reason why I bought the game after seeing a few streams and videos.-----The ""expected"": This game doesn't have a lot of content and it gets grindy very fast where you repeat the same mission (certain expeditions) over and over again. That by itself isn't a huge problem to me, many games I otherwise like work this way. But it may push away many people. And it still leaves a sour aftertaste for a game costing 60 EUR.-----The bad: The balance in this game is really bad.Balance between enemies:some are about as difficult as level 1 critters in WoW, others make bosses in Dark Souls III envious.In general the non-humanoid enemies (beasts etc.) are much easier. The humanoids have incredible aimbots, strong skills and weapons. You open a door to another room and lose half your health within the 0.1 second you didn't immediately step to the side.Balance between builds:The only endgame content are expeditions where rewards are time gated like Mythic+ raids in WoW.But there is no such thing as aggro management nor any significant amount of team heal/support which eliminates every build but the highest DPS build for each class from the get go.Furthermore between Firepower and Ability Power FP simply scales better since it only relies on your gear (which can go up to item level 50) whereas for AP there is a components that makes it scale with your character level (which can only go up to level 30). In consequence at enemy and item level 50 (the highest tier of expeditions) AP builds generally perform worse than FP builds. There is only one type of skill - the anomaly rounds - that really works in an FP build. Only 3 of the 4 classes have access to that, the Devastator is missing out - luckily the Devastator skills are otherwise quite good so an Earthquake Bleed build is usually strong enough. Despite heavy nerfs around the anomaly rounds builds they still are the only ones that are viable for the endgame content for those 3 classes that have it. And until the devs tackle AP scaling this will remain the way it is.Also you will see no such thing as a team composition. In Warframe often times 3 supports and 1 DPS frame makes for a better setup than 4 DPS frames. In Outriders it's 4 DPS classes with top DPS builds for each or bust. And certainly some classes are still better than others. (Technomancer > Trickster/Pyromancer > Devastator)Besides, there is no real reason to play in a party. Enemy HP scale with number of players in your party. But most classes rely on kills to survive. (All but Technomancer.) Which means if you play with 4 players the game is inherently harder than solo. The numbers of enemies also scale but that makes sense - many games do that. Just enemy HP shouldn't scale imo.-----The ugly: Yes, you heard right, the dev's answer to a balance problem is to nerf the ♥♥♥♥ out of whatever works for most people. The devs also lowered the time restrictions for certain expeditions, because they ""felt"" it was ""too generous"". And removed guaranteed legendary drops if you repeat certain story quests. This and the fact that the only endgame content is timegated just shows how backwards their game design choices are. Not fit for a game released in 2021.-----The absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ terrible which makes up for more than 50% of why I chose a don't recommend rating:There are game-breaking bugs. If you join a multiplayer lobby you risk your inventory getting wiped. With the recent patch the same may apply to singleplayer. Yes, you heard right, you can log on right now and your entire character may end up naked. Fun. In the Dwarf Fortress sense of fun. Now add problems where many people can't log in at all (well at least that means their characters aren't getting wiped) or have frequent disconnects.-----In addition to all that I don't understand why they didn't make an offline game. In principle the game works just like Grim Dawn, Torchlight, Diablo II or Borderlands (to list a shooter). So why can't we have characters saved locally (or in the Steam cloud etc.), host our own games, possibly with modding? What's the point of going out of your way to prevent people from cheating in a co-op game? The servers must cost Square Enix a ton. For no purpose whatsoever.In the end I strongly regret spending that much money on this game.",Not Recommended

																Personally I'm rather fond of Outriders - I wanted a loot and shoot game, kinda like Destiny or Remnant. That's what I got. You pick a class, you get cool powers, you shoot some dudes, you get some cool stuff and neat looking guns. There's some end game grinds for item sets and such. I have played the campaign fully co-op and single player with 2 separate classes. I enjoyed myself enormously. I think a lot of the negative reviews come from people expecting a live service game or MMO - which the game is not, however it feels like that in places with it's destiny Esq UI and inventory. As long as you adjust your expectations accordingly, go in for a good 25-30 hour single player game with some extra's for end game replay ability you will enjoy yourself.The graphics are fantastic, the music is good but not memorable. The voice acting ranges from absolutely fantastic to downright awful and hilarious. The gun play is rather fun and powers SUPER satisfying. This is a solid 7.5/10 game that I can recommend when it's on sale.",Recommended

																So, what can I say about Outriders that's good? Because there is some good interspersed between all of the glitches and poor game design and I want to give credit where credit's due.THE GOOD-------------* The lore of this game is just awesome. I really loved the setup and the depth that they go into in all of the various journals and articles. I realize I'm probably in the minority here because I actually read them, but they were enjoyable to read. It was really interesting getting the perspective of the chaos on Earth, the first year of being on the new planet, and all of the different character's thoughts and feelings throughout the game.* I played Pyro and I honestly found the abilities and how your weapons and armor all tied into and enhanced them to be really nice. Is it unique? Nah, but they did a reasonable job with it and there were times where I had some really awesome combo's that made me feel like a true pyromancer. * Some unique and interesting weapons in the game, especially later on, and you weren't punished on ammo like in Destiny 2 where I hear they're still trying to find heavy ammo for their guns to this day...* There's some great side quests that were well written and had some unexpected twists. I enjoyed... most of them!* The game is extremely pretty. It's just a shame that it's all looks and no substance. Okay that's... pretty much it. If you read all of that, you might notice some pretty important things missing. Don't worry... I got you covered in...THE BAD----------* Not gonna lie, this game pissed me off on multiple occasions. Why? Because the combat system is so poorly balanced and even unfair at times. By the time you're level 22 - 26 or so, you've unlocked most of your skill points and things have slowed down as far as new gear coming in so you can start to develop your build a bit and be a bit more stable and consistent in how your skills and weapons work. However! While you're leveling up, you're replacing gear so often that you can't really develop a build at all and you just feel gimped all the frigging time! Combine that with my next point...* The AI are ♥♥♥♥♥! The game offers itself as a cover-based shooter, yet the AI rarely respects that and constantly forces you to run around in the open while chunky boss enemies run right up onto you into short-range combat while their army of snipers pick you off from across the map. Or enemies constantly toss grenades at you or just blindly charge into melee range and start whacking you. As you crank up the world level the enemies get spongier and this becomes more and more frustrating as you can no longer quickly pick enemies off, especially since you're gimped for 1/2 to 3/4 of the game. I dropped the world level to 3 after multiple attempts on 7 and some extremely frustrating boss fights and just mowed my way through the rest of the game. It was always either too brain dead easy or too frustratingly difficult with very little in between.* The cutscenes and the lip sync and the subtitles... I was surprised to see ""Square Enix"" with their name attached to this game when I started it up every play session because while I know they didn't develop it themselves... oh my god the quality was not up to snuff. It's incredible... just absolutely... incredible how badly they screwed up the cutscenes. There were times when the characters spoke before their voice lines played and vice versa. There were also times where the subtitles didn't match up with the characters speaking on screen... and towards the end I had one cutscene where the subtitles played rapid fire and were done wayyyy before the characters were done talking. It was actually insane. The camera is jank as all hell and there's tons of awkward cuts all the time throughout the game. One second they're driving through a horrendous situation and the next they're chilling at camp with no transition. It was SO jarring. Just... not well done at all and made it so hard to get into the world.* They even messed up the quest marker! The janky thing will point to quests you've already completed in an area, even when you've swapped to another quest. They don't let you go back into the area once you've completed the quest unless you go back and redo it... so why is the quest marker telling me that the quest I just selected is going to the area I just completed?! How did this not get fixed in the 4 months since the game came out?!* There was a distinct lack of interactions with a lot of the characters. Many characters just... popped up for a brief time and then never had any sort of role ever again. They never had new voice lines as things happened in the world and in general they were all just throwaway characters to move the plot forward. No depth whatsoever to most of them.* Endgame combat is pretty much a joke... at least, it seems the balance was never really fixed. If you're a pyro, just go with a light machine gun with 150 rounds and Perpetuum Mobile. Congrats! You now have an infinite ammo machine gun that shoots fire rounds and will keep reloading itself as long as you keep killing enemies. Once I got this it made all of my other weapons obsolete and just pointless to use. It's that broken. Infinite ammo, infinite healing, cover no longer mattered and I was just a god running around in the game completely unstoppable. Fun for a few missions, but then it lost its luster.* There's a TON of repetition. The same enemies, the same mission types, over and over and over again. Hell, some of the Bounties you did had the same exact character model for the dude you were hunting. It gets really stale really quick and the final 1/4 of the game is just one area of repetition after another. Tldr; it's frigging boring. * Annnnd finally... the game had an entirely unfulfilling ending. Some spoilers here btw! You've been warned. There's no conclusion whatsoever... the bad guy that you fight... 3 TIMES... is still not dead in the ending credits. For some reason, your character just refuses to kill them and so now they're alive through sheer plot armor for another game. Absolutely nothing is concluded and the game just sets itself up for a really monotonous endgame all to get you to... wait for it... unlock another boss battle in the eye of the storm to..... FIGHT THE SAME GUY FOR A 4TH TIME! Wooo.... and I think he's actually dead this time... maybe. But who really knows? There's just a few comments by the characters from back at camp after this occurs and then that's it. The storm is absolutely the same and there's no extra cutscene or wrap up in any way. You leave and it's just right back to the pod grind.CONCLUSION---------------There's times where I had fun playing this game for sure! But they were quickly drowned out by all of the problems and poor design decisions that went into Outriders. When the final credits played all I could think about was the long list of issues I had experienced throughout the game more than the ""epic conclusion"" to the story. That makes me sad, because like I said earlier, there WAS good writing in places and it had some good moments along the way. I wish they had put more effort into smoothing out all of the issues in Outriders. It really needed another year of development. I'm betting that if it released in April of 2022 instead of April of 2021, we'd have had a much better game than what we got. Even if they do continue the franchise... I'm not sure I care enough at this point to continue playing. The endgame has no meaning and for me... this is going into uninstall land likely never to see my hard drive again.I wholeheartedly recommend that you don't buy this game, at least at full price. For $20? Yeah, it's a pretty okay game for $20. Don't pay more than that. And that's my review. Thanks for reading!",Not Recommended
OUTRIDERS,"Posted: 14 April
																after 77 hrs, levelling a trickster and a devastator, and running expeditions with 2 friends, I absolutely love this game. It has so many features that i love, the loot, customization of the character and loot, the coop play. I just wish I could play it without getting DCed. Im down to 1 friend running expeditions because the other lost his inventory due to a bug, and what time I get with the remaining friend is plagued with disconnects. We often will finish an expedition in gold time and then the host DCs, leaving both of us with 0 loot. Do not spend AAA money on this barely out of alpha ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I want my money, my time, and my friends sanity back.",Not Recommended
OUTRIDERS,"Posted: 24 April
IntroductionOutriders is a third-person looter shooter RPG developed by People Can Fly (PCF). The game is set in a distant future where Earth has collapsed, and humanity is nearing extinction. In a desperate effort to save humankind, the ECA (Enoch Colonization Authority) sends colony ships across the stars with Enoch as destination, a planet similar to Earth, humanity’s last chance of survival. Here, you fill the shoes of a member of the Outriders - an elite group of soldiers - trying to survive on a new and dangerous planet, afflicted by an endless war for survival. Considering PCF’s last work on Bulletstorm, I wasn’t expecting much regarding the narrative. However, to my delight, Outriders has a very well-written and engaging story, accompanied by dense lore and excellent world-building. I’m very fond of how they took a turn with this title and went with a more serious and mature approach. From every character with their distinct personalities and purpose to the dark themes depicted in the plot, it is clear that the writers surpassed themselves this time. GameplayOnce again, the devs nailed the combat system. When I thought they couldn’t exceed their work on Bulletstorm and its combat system, Outriders proved me wrong. The game’s fast-paced, fluid and brutal combat mingled with all sorts of overpowered abilities is by far the highlight of the gameplay experience. This game - at most times - made me feel like a powerful being. Right from the beginning of my adventure, I felt like I was a demigod, teleporting behind enemies and slashing them with my energy sword. The gunplay is also magnificent. From light machine guns to sidearms, every weapon feels authentic and pleasant to handle and shoot. All of that is what makes Outriders’ combat so great in my eyes - it’s all about the fun. I haven't had this much joy slaughtering my enemies and feeling all mighty in a while. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2466949940Unfortunately, the uninspired and flawed level design is the most mediocre aspect of the gameplay. After playing PCF’s previous title, I was really hoping to see a superior level design here in Outriders - though I presume my hopes were all in vain. The levels are very restrictive, following an old-fashioned design akin to other more traditional third-person shooters such as Gears of War, Spec Ops: The Line, and even a more recent title, Remnant: From the Ashes. Here, for most of the time, you will simply be running in a straight line, advancing through combat arenas towards your objective. At first, I thought this wasn’t so bad since third-person shooters usually work similarly. However, at the end of the game, I felt like I essentially played the same level repeatedly for over 30 hours - and that was utterly wearing. Even with the limited level design, the game has a considerable amount of things to do and places to explore. First off, the game has a pretty rewarding exploration system. Throughout the levels, the player can come across loot boxes to expand their arsenal and document files that provide more knowledge about the world surrounding them. Secondly, on almost every map, there will be side quests and activities such as hunts and mercenary jobs, which will reward you with better equipment.I Have The POWER!As I previously said, sometimes, Outriders will make you feel powerful; and that is only possible thanks to the class system. The game has a pretty broad and meaningful class and skills mechanic. There’s a total of 4 classes available right from the start, these being: Technomancer, Pyromancer, Trickster, and Devastator. Each of those is unique, with its distinct abilities, skill trees, and roles in combat. For instance, the Trickster - the one I’m the most familiar with - is a more agile class, mainly focusing on close-range combat, with impressive powers such as teleportation, time rifts, temporal anomalies, and many more abilities that fiddle with the concept of space and time. After playing with each class, I must say that the Trickster is by far my favorite. I had so much fun toying with my enemies, shooting them, and then vanishing into thin air only to appear on the other side of the combat arena. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2466983836Along with the classes, the game also has an extensive skill tree where the player can spend the points they received after leveling up. You will earn 20 skill points throughout the game to spend the way you desire - with the possibility to relocate them at any time you wish with no costs. For those like myself who fancy creating all sorts of builds, that is a great feature. Performance & Issues  PC SpecsGPU: RTX 3080CPU: Ryzen 5 5600x RAM: 32GB Outriders has a significant problem concerning the difficulty and balancing. The difficulty as well as the loot, are both tied to the World Tiers. Hence, the higher the tier, the better your loot and tougher your enemies. This mechanic by itself isn’t a problem. It is quite the contrary; it’s reasonably compelling and serves to encourage you to play in higher difficulty settings. However, the execution was pretty awful. The game on higher tiers is totally broken and thoroughly unfair - and this is more evident when playing solo. For example, I lost count of how many times I got one shot by a sniper with superhuman reflexes or had my health leeched in seconds by some random enemy scout - it is so unbalanced that it becomes frustrating. I know for a fact that one of the concerns of many people - myself included - regarding games similar to Outriders is: can it be played solo? Fortunately, yes, it can. Nevertheless, that doesn’t mean they designed this title with enough thought on the single-player experience. For starters, there’s no offline mode in Outriders; you’re always required to be connected to their servers while playing - and that is something very troublesome, as every now and then, the servers will eventually go under maintenance or have some issue, making it impossible to play, even by yourself. Sadly, that is a recurrent issue. By the end of my journey, I was tired of getting kicked out of my game session and seeing that “Internet Connection Error” message. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like the devs will implement an offline mode anytime soon - if ever. So if you recently bought or are planning on purchasing this title, then you better hold on tight to endure the tiring and endless disconnects.If you thought Outriders couldn’t have more issues, then I have some bad news for you. The entire game is a bug-fest, with several minor glitches and a few aggravating game-breaking bugs. These range from a crucial cutscene with no sound, inaccessible quest areas, and invincible enemies to even having your whole progress wiped. Throughout my time playing Outriders, I encountered almost every kind of bug present in the game, but what infuriated me the most was the constant crashing. I already lost count of how many times I saw that stupid bird flying across my screen when re-entering the game after a crash. Performance-wise, the game lacks polish. I didn’t have a stable frame rate throughout my playthrough; it usually runs around 80-100FPS, but with huge stutterings, dragging down the frame rate, causing the game to be unplayable at times.ConclusionOutriders had everything to be one of the best games of the genre, with its amazing gunplay, entertaining narrative, and exciting class system. And I’d really have liked to recommend it. However, afflicted by many issues and questionable design choices, the game fails to deliver a solid and remarkable experience. Overall, regardless of the fun I had, I can’t recommend this game in its current state. Wait for a sale.",Not Recommended
Jurassic World Evolution 2,"Posted: 9 November
																I don't understand how they messed this up twice... This feels very reminiscent of the launch of the last game, but even more dysfunctional. For every point of feedback from the fans they listened to, they seem to have taken multiple steps back. Just...how?Campaign mode borders on being the laziest part of the entire game and can be beaten in under 3 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hours, with the bulk of what you actually want to do being reallocated to Chaos Theory mode. This game is completely disorganized compared to the previous one.They removed a couple aspects of tedium only to double down and ramp it up in other cases. Hooray, they removed the stupid contract teams. Holy ♥♥♥♥, they added fuel and staff micromanagement + having to manually scan dino conditions constantly?!?!?! WHY? WHO WANTED THIS?!?!?! THEY KEPT THE SABOTAGE MECHANIC. Why would you keep this?!!?! It was almost unanimously HATED. WHY?!?! Why would you make ranger team additions an UPGRADE MODULE?!?!There are constant visual bugs with light artefacting that is giving people serious migraines, myself included.It is not necessarily a terrible game, but it is absolutely not worth the asking price and it is incredibly disappointing that they seemed to have disregarded so much feedback from the fans and made this game less fun in favor of mindless tedium. I don't understand how they can get planet zoo right, but ♥♥♥♥ up Jurassic World TWICE. That is impressively stubborn and it makes me think the devs have their heads up their own ass as far as their design philosophy goes.And if the devs are reading this, how do you not understand that we wanted a much grander version of JPOG? HOW DID YOU NOT FIGURE THAT OUT? How is it that the modding scene along with all of its overhauls and improvements to the first evolution by removing a ♥♥♥♥ ton of the mind numbing tedium NOT tip you off that ""hey, maybe players just want to be able to have an extravaganza in our game and we should focus on working on mechanics that help facilitate that and give players lots of options and content?"" Instead, you made staff micromanagement a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nightmare and now everything meaningful needs scientists which has caused the game to slow to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ crawl. Congratulations.I hate to be mean, but the blueprints were right in front of you guys and you went off the wall AGAIN.Every aspect of tedium that should NOT have made it into this game:- Scientists being needed for everything. There is so much excessive micromanagement now and you can no longer effectively have multiple things going on at once like you could in the previous game. Sorry, STAFF BUSY.- Same as the above, but RPG stat requirements on the scientists to tackle not only research, but hatchery incubation (which is multi-staged now with different requirements), expeditions, fossil extractions, etc. Sorry, but you need 3 scientists with 4 Logistics to do 'x'. Sorry, but you can only use 3 scientists to do 'y', so they need to have at least 5 genetics. WHY? NO ONE wanted this. This is multi-layered tedium.- Ranger team numbers being gutted- Dinosaur status scans being constant. If you were going to introduce this mechanic, it should have been exclusive to the campaign and done ONCE per species for immersion factor. ♥♥♥♥ off with this constant ""requires status check"" BS. (Yes, I know ranger posts automate this, but they're bugged & goes back to the ranger team #'s problem. The point is that this shouldn't even be a mechanic to begin with. It adds NOTHING to the game other than another layer or micromanagement tedious nonsense.)- Scientists needing to be manually told to rest- Fuel for generators (AND main buildings) vs the same ugly ass pylon + station spams from the first game.- The sabotage mechanic still being in the game.- Severe reduction of building efficiencies- Demolishing buildings takes time now. Why...?- You still have to manually refill your feeders (or the response facilities if you spam ranger posts). At least they increased the reserves this time.- Sandbox mode is, yet again, heavily locked down like when it was first introduced in JWE. You have to play through the rest of the game and unlock everything in order to get access to said things in sandbox mode. Hope y'all weren't hoping to just jump in and play to heart's creative content.- Highly restrictive map borders and unoptimized landscaping are still issues- New Fossil slot system is a huge downgrade.I took time off of work for this. We got bamboozled by the marketing.Edit: Good news. As of an hour ago, 6:30 EST, a few of the popular trainer sites now have working trainers for this game that get rid of some of the tedium. My advice, play with those trainers.Edit 2: Wow, didn't realize this review would blow up. I suppose I should address a few things since the comment section has already devolved.Yes, I was mad, sleep deprived and suffering from a severe migraine (induced by one of the bugs in this game) when I initially made the review. I am not changing it to tone down the dramatic anger at the time. What happened happened and it would be dishonest of me to do so and try and backpedal. Take that for what you will.Yes, I understand that some of the tedium is just ""takes 5 seconds"" level of exaggeration, but that time accumulates and builds up and infringes on other things. These types of comments are completely missing the point... The point was that there is so much combined tedium that completely ruins the experience and that it has completely robbed the game of any enjoyment for me and apparently many others.Yes, I understand that some of you wanted this level of micromanagement. However, I think you should consider the fact that many of us did NOT want that and have gone to equal lengths and contributions to make that apparent to the devs. Our opinions and play time matter just as much as yours. The devs could have, at the very least, implemented more optionality into the core gameplay, maybe have a hard micromanagement mode (for you guys) and a stripped down more creative mode (for the rest of us). If you feel personally targeted by this review, then I am sorry but that is not my issue.Yes, there are positives to this game. I do acknowledge that and I didn't really think it was necessary to list them out when my position is concerned with the overwhelming negatives. If I didn't list it here, then it should be safe to say I didn't have too much of a problem with it. However, if absolutely necessary...Positives:+ With the exception of a few changes to the UI that look less polished than the first Evolution, Evo 2 is still gorgeous in its overall aesthetic. You won't find a better looking dinosaur management game than this mini franchise.+ The soundtrack is simply wonderful. If anything, I think this is the one decision I am fine with and even applaud them for. The soundtrack was beautiful in the last game and that carries over to this one.+ New dinosaur animations/behaviors are always a welcome plus. We needed a bit more, but I will give credit to the fact that there are more.+ Aquatic and actual Aviary habitats this time around... This is what most were excited for and they mostly delivered. Could be better.+ Time manipulation is your biggest saving grace for cutting down on tedium.+ Mixed Eras is base in Sandbox now.Unfortunately none of this makes up for the negatives, from the ones carried over from the first game, from all of the tedium outlined above, from the continual use of the obtuse Cobra engine (which has somehow even worse in terms of optimization this time around), from the lazy double campaign (main + CT). Buy it on saleEdit 3: Once again, I am sorry if some of you feel personally targeted by this review. I know I have already said this, but I am now receiving random friend requests from people in the comment section who then want to bombard me with why I am wrong. I am not gonna debate on a personal level about this game.",Not Recommended
Jurassic World Evolution 2,"Posted: 9 November
																Frontier has had phenomenal success with Planet Zoo. It's one my favourite games ever. The depth it offers is seemingly endless, and all facets of the game are approached with love and care. The same cannot be said for Jurassic World Evolution, and, sadly, nor this sequel.I was hopeful that Evolution 2 would learn what to keep and what to discard, but in action it's effectively the same game with a few additions. I find it genuinely difficult to tell what's new here. This game is not worth even half of its asking price, let alone does it constitute a separate game from the original. It calls to mind Dead Island: Riptide or Saints Row 4 (which I liked, but I digress) being spun out of DLC for another game.  The constraints of consoles are a recurrent complaint when talking about Planet Zoo versus Jurassic World Evolution, and though it's an apt point one must keep in mind when comparing the two, the sheer difference in quality between them becomes apparent when you look at any mechanic that the latter has. Evolution 2 is dominated by superficial and annoying elements that serve only to bog the game down in monotonous waiting. The AI is clunky, jeeps still cannot enter even slightly dense forests, the controls are sluggish, the fuelling and scanning mechanic is a truly baffling regression, and the campaign is absolutely dominated by timers that could take 1/20 of the time and still serve the same purpose. Sandbox content being locked behind progression in the campaign and challenge mode is another nonsensical decision that entirely defeats the purpose of it being a creative mode. The voice acting is average and used almost exclusively for cringe-worthy dialogue. I've had numerous graphical bugs, including a constant flickering in the fifth campaign (yes, I'm on the latest driver specifically for JWE2), though nothing major. Some positives, well, the download size is good I guess, as an Australian that's always a blessing. Jokes aside, the environments are realised very well and I do enjoy how open some of the campaign maps are. It lends a very safari-esque feel to the game. The dinosaurs and other included animals are similarly animated and modelled up to the standard that Frontier set with the first game and Planet Zoo. Regrettably, graphics alone cannot carry a game. Jurassic World Evolution was a very simple park simulator that failed to incorporate any of the depth introduced to the genre by the titans that preceded it. Many of us afforded Frontier leeway with this sequel as it was assumed that they would work on the problems of the first game. I'm tempted to say this is even worse, if only because they had the feedback to fix it, have done nothing with it, and in other aspects even doubled down.If you liked the first, it's a slight refinement that introduces a few fan favourite animals like the pteranodon and mosasaurus. It's tantamount to a remaster that introduces a couple little gimmicks that'll keep you occupied for a few minutes.EDIT AFTER CHAOS THEORY COMPLETION (11/11/2021): I've put fifteen more hours into the game since I wrote this review, and in that time have completed all five chaos theory levels. I wanted to give the game more of a chance, as forming an opinion from a few hours of gameplay can be shortsighted. People have been saying that the campaigns are more of a tutorial, and be that as it may, they fail to delve into any of the guest mechanics that are fleshed out in the sequel. My advice is to skip them and go straight into either chaos theory or the challenge modes, as either explore the game mechanics in much greater depth. The third and fifth chaos theory campaigns aren't worth the time, as both are marked by either repetitive or restricted gameplay.The aforementioned flickering dominates every map, and is accompanied by a motion blur that I've read is due to a specific anti-aliasing setting. This leads to goofy results, because it makes the dinosaurs look like they're the Flash or Quicksilver runnin' around in the Cretaceous.  This added time has served only to further peel back the admittedly very beautiful facade that masks a fundamentally broken game. There is not a game in the world that should require this level of management to do simple tasks. I've put far too much time into ARK: Survival Evolved not to immediately recognise this manner of silly time wasting. You want to hatch a dinosaur? Here's a menu to select your 66+ million year old killing machine from! Now you get to pick some scientists to work on creating the eggs. A further minute~ later and you get to go into another menu to view and select the eggs. You then need to select more scientists to work on incubating the eggs and raising the young. After this, you get to go back once again and release the animal. The animal then takes about 30+ seconds to finish its exit animation before you can select it. Fortunately the developers were generous enough to allow you to view its statistics immediately after it exits the breeding chamber, as you'll unfortunately soon need to establish scans so that you can view its statistics. Your dinosaur has a health problem? Well, send the medics to do a scan and check what's wrong! If it's a disease, you get to select some scientists from a menu to waste a few minutes researching the illness, all so you can send the medic back to cure it. If your dinosaur has an injury, fun times are ahead, because you get to tranquillise it, transport it to the medic facility, select more scientists, wait until it's healed, and then transport it back. The game is chock full of similar time sinks, which isn't exactly the type of gameplay that one wishes to dominate this much time in a dinosaur zoo simulator game. Once you realise that the modules of your stores must be tailored to the guest type, money and your park rating become much simpler issues. Lagoons are wholly underdeveloped, featuring no customisation and the peculiar inability to navigate the camera beneath the water without first selecting marine reptiles from the map. It's a shame, because the marine reptiles that are in the game are a breath of fresh air, but they simply float through an endless and unchanging void. Perhaps the greatest sin of Evolution 2 is its habitat building. Arguably the biggest draw to this game -- and really any zoo simulator -- is the ability to build habitats in which you can see your animals live and breath. You have a number of rocks that you can choose from, which you cannot stack. All trees come in the form of brushes, which replace one another when intersecting. Water is shallow and circular, leading to featureless ponds. Though the expertly animated dinosaurs may indicate that there's depth to expect here, the total lack of behavioural variety belays the simplicity behind them. Whereas Planet Zoo will have a monkey leaping through trees, climbing through a beautiful environment, playing with toys, mating, socialising, fighting, sleeping, stressing out from visitors, pooping, etc, Evolution 2 has animals that wander around, sit, eat, and sometimes hunt or fight. Much the same as the marine reptiles drift through an endless sea, this game's land animals are static.If I had to put it in a few lines: With Jurassic World Evolution, Frontier dropped the ball. With Planet Zoo, they picked it back up in a big way. With Jurassic World Evolution 2, they proceeded to drop the ball back into a black hole that destroyed the earth (and my soul). The dinosaurs should count themselves lucky that they aren't around anymore.",Not Recommended
Jurassic World Evolution 2,"Posted: 13 November
																I loved the first game (after DLCs and patches). The campaign feels more like a tutorial. It's short and there's no optional objectives like 5 starring each island in the first game. You can't even use the vast majority of the dinos in the campaign, and it doesn't even introduce aquatic reptiles.Aside from content issues, they've really overdone it with how high maintenance the dinos are. I could not go a full minute without dinos getting sick or injured, despite all being at 100% comfort. This meant I was constantly having to send the heli to tranquilize, and then transport them to the medical facility. It's just not fun to micromanage to this degree, as it was taking up all my time, preventing me from researching, sending expeditions, or building more attractions (not to mention customizing them).I want to love this game, but it just feels like the fun stuff is inaccessible due to the sheer amount of chores that need to be attended to at all times.",Not Recommended

																I was going to wait till after christmas to see if this was going to get better, but with down right frustrating stuff going on here, nah this needs to be done now. This is abysmally annoying compared to the first.I'll start off with the pros:Paleobotany is now a part of paddock building itself, very welcome very nice. Good step up.Automation on the park vehicles is a lot better now... for the most part.Slightly bigger maps, though it may not seem like it where 1's were stretched out into long thin lines, these are all most compact and lumpy.Slightly better building things, but not by much.Looks pretty good again, the added colours are most welcome as 1 just had various shades of green and im running it max settings on a legion 5 laptop at about 50-60 fps (over 60 on some of the smaller maps).Some more customisation to the buildings (im honestly a sucker for detailing and doodads).That's about it, and now onto the cons, and this hurts because it outright proves they arn't listening to fans ATALL:There are NO cosmetic prop options now minus rocks, and those rocks are placed randomly with no control. I am outright sick of this ""random placement mechanics"" bullcrap on things, it's almost as if they think people have no imagination and can't doit themselves. I know for a fact, several posts have been BEGGING for more trees, fallen tree logs, old busted ingen things.... did we get ANY of this? No, because ""the stars are the dinosaurs!"" and you made the dinosaurs boring AGAIN! :EDIT: There are some decorative props added to place around in the guests area of the park (in chaos and sandbox modes), however there is still absolutely nothing for the paddocks...Pointless, NEEDLESS stuff added into both ranger maintenance and dinosaur care. Dino ill? Tranq and send to vet. Broken leg? Send to vet. Grazed knee? OOP! It might make the dino a little disgruntled, OFF TO THE VET FOR YOU!! (For a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ GRAZED KNEE!). Also, why oh WHY do I have to go look at the dino's every 5 minutes to know if they are ok? I can see them, yes hello, one is waving their little claw at me but i have to send this guy in to get owned by you now.... I mean its not like the movie had movement sensors, mics and cameras in the paddocks to keep tabs on that kind of thing. No, none of that, NOT LIKE YOU DON'T EVER SEE MULDOON ON ONE, IN A PARK WHERE THEY HAVE SPARED NO EXPENSE! *smacks head on desk....*Frustrating fuel and food system now. It's actually a bit harder to make money in this one, fair play was FAR to easy to get in the first one...to offset this, they give you less while making you spend WAY MORE on keeping all the sub stations fueled, the vehicles, the food prep its absolutely pathetic.So many things are not explained until the last minute / it's to late. Lets have an example, UNREST. It does not tell you what this is, it doesn't pop up with a little box when you hover over it, there is no first level tutorial to help you through the new things.... when you are just aboutt to hit a sabotage event, THEN it tells you what unrest does! THEN it tells you, you need to keep resting them up and spending out MORE to keep your scientists happy too, so more money, time, boring, boring, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ YOU ARE WORKING WITH DINOSAURS AND YOU ARE COMPLAINING!?!?!? ILL DO IT, FOR FREE!!!!! (oh and you need to build a staff building before you can do that.......)NO AI or time spent on the dinosaurs outside making them look pretty....AGAIN. No personality quirks, no random fights, no actual logic... just top trumps once more, even put this in my last one they are just for show and nothing more. OH! and don't expect to have fun putting different dinosaurs in with each other anymore, they now absolutely HATE each other and you have to make sure you don't, *GASP!* PUT A SAUROPOD IN, WITH ANOTHER SAUROPOD!! I mean who'd have EVER THOUGHT 2 kinds of sauropod would like each other huh!?!? I kid you not...I used to love making a longneck paddock with ALL of them, big huge one...I can no longer do this, because apparently diplodicus insulted brachiosaur MANY centuries ago and have a long lasting vegi hatred toward each other....... this is beyond stupid.Incredbly boring, short campaign. You no longer get 4-5 things todo per island anymore, you no longer get any of the factions vying for your time.... what you do get, is one thing todo per mission, most can be completed in 20 minutes and mission 4 is an absolute joke. ""build aviary! make pteranadons happy!....YOU ARE DONE!! WOOOOOO!! YOU CAN BREATH IN AN OUT, HAVE A COOKIE!! that one takes 10 minutes -_-.Bad callbacks to 1. All 3 of the department heads return, for some reason. They don't say hi, they don't have a chat with all the people from the first, its like it never happened. Poor entertainment dude just about gets to say ""oh yeah hi im alive!"" and Dua, the worst one gets an entire mission devoted to her annoying, contradictive, hypocritical voice (you'll find out when you play, basically all her dialogue from 1 is a joke now).Horrible banter between Claire and Owen. Everyone hated Finch? I liked Finch and he had some funny dad jokes.... I now miss those dad jokes, because I have these 2 hollywod designed morons, split apart again and smashed together like an 8 year old girl playing with barbie and ken. No thanks.Combining buildings. No! No!!!! I can't stand the ranger's and ACU now linked together, keep hitting T expecting to get my haxy tranq copter up but now I get ""the vet""... We asked you for more not less...1 step forward 10 back.NOTHING can be unlocked playing campaign mode or chaos mode. That's right, those dinos, skins and preorder bonus you spent out for? Yeah, ALL locked behind Challenge mode :) The worst one out the lot! So basiically there is no point playing the actual game or chaos till that is done....No thanks, I actually HATED challenge mode, being forced to rush and do things quickly makes me tune out (why oh why would you make a game that you have to spend time on, quick to complete and then shove in timed challenges? are you afraid no one is going to play it unless it only last an hour now? Do you REALLY think people's attention spans are that small- OH LOOK A COMPY! HEHEHEHEHEHH (same thing happened with terraria really...)Addendum: I no longer feel guilty due to sheer frustration, here is more. Chaos theory is boring and artificially extended to hair losingly frustrating point. JP, Lost World and JP 3 are all quite easy, just take AGES to grind.... infact, JP 3 is an utter joke and can be completed as fast as campaign modes 4th mission.OUT RIGHT ♥♥♥♥ Jurassic World. You have to grind grind grind grind grind! You can BARELY make money, while being expected to spend FAR to much, everything will start dieing by the time you get to getting the mausasaurus, so good luck rebuying them all while affording the almost 10 million it takes to properly build a pen, train one release it ETC if not more, while struggling to deal with scripted tornados, that no longer seem random, that seem to ALWAYS take the ♥♥♥♥ you path...the EXPENSIVE, park destroying, you may as well quit now ♥♥♥♥ you path.

																I wanna say this game is great, I wanna say this game is fun and addictive because it kind of is, I accidentally played this game from 1pm till 5am. But the game has Argentinasarus-sized problems namely the *extremely* heavy focus on chores, this game is more chore than park builder; Triceratops hurt itself fighting a herd member? Well, manually tell the Vet to identify whats wrong, manually tell a chopper to come and tranq it, then manually tell *another* chopper to take the Trike back to the Vet office and manually tell which scientist to spray magic heal stuff onto the dino (Seriously.. why not just a lazy animation of a scientist standing next to the dino with a clipboard instead of the weird robot healing spray that heals broken ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bones???) and then manually tell the chopper to bring the dino back to its enclosure. All of that just to keep a dinosaur from dying to it's own scripted behaviour. Why? Just why, Frontier?Want to recruit scientists? Well, pray to RNGesus who's church is just down the block cus you'll need 'im on your side if you want a well rounded staff and not severely lacking in some departments because it's very easy for the game to give you a scientist who's really 'good' in the Genetics department but can have NO skill points IN the genetics skill, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ WHY, Frontier?Dinosaur behaviours have got to be really cool though... right? I mean, if you really enjoy most of your dinosaurs having extreme and random beef with their enclosure buddies and CONSTANTLY trying to kill eachother even if they're within their perfect environments and are supposedly ""content"" I don't know how many times my Dilophosarus 3 and 5 would literally give eachother organ failure and the second both were healed up and put back into their enclosures I'd almost immediately get another warning that they would be fighting and having to fight the UI because alot of the time the dinosaurs hitbox seems to disappear entirely and the game doesnt recognize youre hovering over a dino and you have to exit the ranger or vet management view and reopen it. Sometimes your  vet team will indefinitely try to heal a dinosaur that naturally healed back up because the Vet truck decided it needed to go forwards and backwards for 10 minutes because a single palm tree is infront of it and the AI doesn't understand what left or right areTLDR; Jurassic World? More like do ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ chores and turning every single simple act into a 15 step process that pulls the player away from building a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ park like you're supposed to be doing and forcing you to wonder how the ♥♥♥♥ you're supposed to make money",Not Recommended

																Overall: Not worth $60 and $17 Day one DLC for 5 dinos, leaves a terrible taste in the mouth. Don't get it till price drops. Most of these ""Improvements"" could've been a free update or a DLC not a $60 price tag. Could've added an AI patch and released a biome with Aquatic dino DLC. What I really wanted to see was the depth planet zoo have in terms of building and park management. Don't really care for chaos theory or campaign. At this point we just want to play planet zoo dinosaurs if this is the best Fronteir can do with the Jurassic Park IP(being limited by Universal I assume). Could've saved money on voice actors and licensing Jurassic Park. Can't wait for Prehistoric Kingdom.Buidling:Building Enclosures is so shallow. Build a the enclosure drop some foilage and a watering hole and you're done.

																Suprisingly this game has a lot more negative reviews on launch than I though it would so, i'm gonna talk about the positive things. Firstly, the game has beautiful graphics and the dinos look amazing in game. The game has more dinosaurs than the first game with the addition of revamped flying reptiles and the new marine reptiles; while I haven't seen them in game I've seen enough youtube videos on them to say that the aquatics are great, though they are mainly for show since they don't really do anything special other than swim around and eat fish (or sharks for the Mosasaur). I haven't looked at the flying reptiles in any way yet via in game or youtube but, they are definitely better than in the first game. There are more flying reptiles to choose from when making them and you can edit the terrain in the enclosure plus, when they break out instead of flying away never to be seen again they terrorize your park until you get them under control.Gameplay (Campaign):In the campaign you follow Claire and Owen across the U.S. to safely locate and enclose dinosaurs that are scattered across the country after the events of Fallen Kingdom. The gameplay is quite different from the first game since your goal isn't to create but, gather dinosaurs into a certain location. You will have to safely bring dinosaurs into your facility/park?. You either rescue the dinosaurs in the outskirts of your current location or have your scientists abduct them from places across the country via the expedition center. The gameplay is also more tedious due to you having to send rangers to get a status checks on the dinosaurs to see their comfort and use the medical center to treat dinos with major injuries. While the new mechanics can be a handful since you have to do so much I prefer it over the first game since it's more engaging. I've heard off of pre-release reviews that the campaign is relatively short being around 3 hours. This is not as long as the first game which was around 10 hours to complete though, the main thing to make up for this is Chaos Theory.In Chaos Theory you follow the Jurassic Park/World movies in ""what if?"" scenarios. I haven't gotten the chance to play it yet but, I've heard it isn't all that great basically being from what I've heard ""what if you were in charge of the park?"". I'm not going to really judge it until I play it so take this portion with a grain of salt.Overall: The game is basically just a big DLC from the first game with extra mechanics, new dinosaurs, better graphics, and a new side story with the title of ""campaign"" slapped on it. From what I have played though I really enjoy it and recommended to anybody who really enjoyed the first game though, if you are new to the franchise just play the first game and wait for this to come on sale.If you actually read all of this thank you and I hope this helped you decide if you are going to purchase the game or not. If you do get it I hope you enjoy it as much as I am.",Recommended

																I generally hate survival games.  You know the ones i mean, the ones that became almost overnight megahits a few years back like Ark, Rust etc.  Anyone who's tried to actually play one knows spawn campers and the shoot on sight mentality makes it rough without a very large group.I didn't expect to really, truly like this game as even without the PvP I thought it'd be the same tired old grind.  Chop down some trees, make a house, blah blah blah.  Jesus I was wrong.  First thing i noticed is the enemies are actually pretty terrifying.  I'd be chopping down a tree or hunting a deer and hear screeching from something that didn't even sound human anymore coming from way too close for comfort only for a mutant cannibal thing to leap out a tree at me and almost give me a heart attack. This isn't something you ever really get used to either.  The mutants are unsettling as hell in the best way possible.  Sometimes they'll just watch you from the distance, sometimes they'll screech at you without attacking.  Even when you expect them to attack, they're stealthy as hell and almost always surprise me.  It's also got the typical survival fanfare down to a science.  You're next upgrade is always right around the corner, but never easy to come by.  Combining that rock solid gameplay loop with terrifying enemies causes The Forest to transcend every other survival game I've ever tried.  It's fun, terrifying, and mysterious in the best way possible.  Cannot reccomend this game highly enough.",Recommended

																Do you like Survival games where you craft things? How about horror games that can still take you by surprise every now and then even after playing for hours? Well then this game is for you.  The game takes mechanics from both of these genres to give you an unsettling, yet fun experience in one game. Build a base and defend it from mutant cannibals that roam the island, explore caves to find items to make your life easier, and solve the mysterys of the peninsula. Plus, this game has an actual storyline for your to complete. The main character, Eric LeBlanc's plane crashes on the island and his son Timmy is kidnapped by a mysterious man covered in red paint. You'll need to explore caves to find key items to help you in your search for Timmy and get to the bottom of the sinkhole in the center of the island.   Don't wanna defend your base from the mutants that roam the map? Well good news is there's a difficulty setting you can pick called ""Peaceful"" This makes it to where no mutants appear on the surface and will only appear in caves. I can't recommend this mode personally because it takes a chunk out of the gameplay experience. But if you're looking for a mode where you can build stuff anywhere uninterrupted, this might be a good option.Now it's time to talk about the Mutants. There's actually two kinds of mutants. There's the standard humanoid cannibal mutants which you will see quite frequently (as long as you're not playing peaceful mode) and then there's the bizarre and deformed Creepy Mutants.The standard humanoid mutants are probably the most interesting from a technical standpoint. Their AI is set up to behave differently depending upon interactions with the player among other factors. The developers have stated that they left a bit of fogginess in the mutants' behaviors so that players will never fully figure them out.  There is a way to turn them completely docile to the player but it's very hard to do. They come in a variety of ""tribes"" with varying grotesque skin tones. From a more humanoid tan to dark blue and pale.In addition, there are starved skinny variants of each mutant type. These mutants are crazed and attack out of desperation. They'll also stop to eat dead bodies occasionally, even in the heat of battle. These mutants are faster than their more sane counterparts but have less health.Now for the creepy mutants. The creepy mutants are more dangerous than the standard humanoid mutants and can level a player's base if left unchecked. They're normally found in caves exclusively but after about 5-10 days they start roaming the surface, often in patrols.  These patrols are very dangerous without the proper weapons, I don't want to spoil these guys for you so I won't talk in as much detail as I did about the humanoid mutants. I will say that the creepy mutants are a lot more predictable than the humanoid as they don't examine you when they see you deciding to attack or not,  instead they just charge at you. Their attacks have enough force to strip the player of armor, kill other mutants, level the player's base in seconds, and even knock down trees! Truly, they're not something to take lightly.And this concludes this review. If you found it helpful leave a thumbs up and/or a comment.",Recommended

Early Access Review
								I highly recommend this game to anyone who can tolerate nudity and gore. This can be just a survival game as you can turn the cannibals off on the main menu, but to me the cannibals are the meat and potatoes of this game and I find myself sorely missing them should they not come visit me a couple of times a day. The AI in this game is honestly the best I’ve encountered. The game now features different types of cannibals with tribes that will fight if you watch silently, but will mostly unite in their hatred of the guy deforesting their land, (you). The cannibals will still throw a couple of punches at each other if there’s enough of them around however. There are starving cannibals who will try to stalk you to find out where you live and try to scavenge off any kills you make, scouts for larger tribes who will often simply run away to alert others of your locations, hunting parties (though I’m pretty sure they’re only hunting you), and cannibals just trying to live out their lives in peace that you can finding sleeping in camps or caves. Cannibals will duck and roll to evade attacks, climb trees to escape, light tennis balls on fire and throw them at you, wreck your base if you’re not careful, but they’ll also do things like drop effigies which you can catch them praying at if left uninterrupted, they’ll drag their wounded out of battle if they can, and will run off to retrieve others if you let them escape. Beyond the normal humanoid cannibals there are mutants who can always be found in caves, but will surface more frequently the more you piss the cannibals off. These (with the exception of the babies) are significantly tougher to kill and do a lot more damage. If they come near your base they mean business and while the spider mutant takes a couple of hits to tear anything down, I’ve seen armsy rip a tree OUT OF THE GROUND and slam it into my base, destroying multiple defensive spikes and walls allowing the small army of ten or so he brought with him entrance into the base. The sumo dude doesn’t even need to do anything super special to wreak havoc, if he runs at your base everything in his path will be destroyed until he stops running.How the cannibals interact with you is highly determined by your playstyle, though I don’t think they’d ever be friendly with you. If you escape the plane crash quickly before they find you and are not stalked, you can have the opportunity to build a base without their knowledge if you pick a private enough location not on one of their common routes, and they generally won’t find it unless you are followed home. If in contrast you do everything you can to piss them off (mass cannibal killings, mutant killings, effigy destruction and creation, burning their bodies in front of them), they will be significantly more inclined to bother you constantly. In my current single player game I see at least 4-6 spider mutants a day somewhat near my base, 1-2 armsies, and the sumo dudes have only just started coming out so luckily it’s been one at a time. Even though I am absolutely plagued by mutants, I can always ghost them and move to a different part of the map. You’re in control of how much you see them, which really makes the game AI feel more real and dynamic.Multiplayer is significantly less “scary” but if you wanted to build massive bases it’s SOOOOOOOO much faster. It’s a lot of fun playing with friends and pissing mutants off but there is some charm lost from having others about in the forest with you. In single player the fear comes from the cannibals coming out of nowhere and overwhelming you, which really doesn’t happen in multiplayer. Sure when you’re in the caves they’ll still drop from the ceiling but when it’s two against three your odds are a lot better and you know it, diluting the terror. I know this “review” was all over the place but the game is definitely worth full price. I mostly just wanted to mention stuff that combats all the people saying they’ve never seen the mutants do much. It has the best music and you get a nice sense of accomplishment having to collect each cassette individually.",Recommended

																The Forest is all about surviving and getting out alive but, now that I finally did it, I can't wait to get back to it in the upcoming sequel!Pros: Exceptional exploration with no hand holding. Caves that are better dungeons than those in most RPG games. Ambient audio. The forest can really look gorgeous. Unpredictable A.I. makes the natives look and feel threatening Simple but functional crafting system. Original and fun inventory design.Cons: Impolished/buggy. Could use more hotkeys. Enemies in the caves should respawn. Enemies in the middle of my base should not. Items respawning in the same place are easily exploitable and kind of silly.What you're probably thinking is that The Forest is a survival focused game where you're supposed to build a fort and simply persist. Cant blame you for I was under the same impression until I got my hands on the game.While survival can be the name of the game, me and my friends led mostly nomadic lives, building only what was necessary to spend the night while catering only to the most basic needs and staying constantly on the move throughout the peninsula and its network of underground caves in pursuit of our goals.It is up to you to choose how you want to play and set your own pace for exploration as The Forest's gameplay is flexible and free-form. I'd say it was more of an adventure than a survival game for most of us but, that does not have to apply to you and your band of brothers.Personally, I enjoyed the exploration the most and can't even remember all of the times that The Forest left me gasping in amazement. Successfully navigating through and surviving the perils of the cave systems felt like a rewards of it's own to which the frequent “lore chunks” and occasional gear upgrades were more of a cherry on top.The lack of hand holding greatly amplified the reward and the experience for me as everything we did, every cave that we successfully navigated and went through felt like it was 100% our doing as there were no “arrows” guiding our way to take the credit, and the moderate consumption and distribution of previously prepared rations encouraged us to embark on another expedition and conquer the peninsula and all of it's nook's and cranny's, one by one.Other than exploration, there's also a simple yet sufficient base building aspect to The Forest.Cutting down trees to make walls and huts, getting familiar with, harvesting and eventually cultivating local flora (and even some fauna) comes with advantages of their own – as well as the consequences.Sure, it's great to have a place called home but should you stay in it for too long and make a ruckus while doing it, be prepared to deal with your new and openly unhappy neighbors.The natives will take actions proportionate to yours (or so it seemed to us) so if you desecrate their hunting groves or over-expand into their territory, be prepared for more than a couple of sleepless nights. Also keep in mind that violence breeds violence so, if it's not necessary or in self-defense, try not to cast the first stone. Cowering in the nearby bushes or simply running away is probably the best option - unless you crave bloodshed.One last thing to mention is that, unlike most games dabbling in the survival genre, The Forest actually has the beginning and the ending. It even provides the player with optional activity that will encourage exploration and investigation which I highly recommend doing as it will shed some light on the history of the the land and events that took place there.Whether it's a good story or a mediocre one, well, that's up for you to decide but I can say that I really liked it and that it definitely wasn't a bad one. Those of you who liked “LOST”, the TV show, you will most likely appreciate this one. Bullsh!t ending not included.Still having doubts? I say pick it up!Support the small, creative team and help them make a sequel worthy of The Forest. I personally can't recommend it enough.",Recommended

																Backstory :  I started with MS Flightsim on an amber screened IBM clone in 1987. It took several 'disks' to load, and I would go make coffee and  drink most of it before it would be loaded and ready to play. Looking back, it was simply atrocious. It had no graphics to speak of, ran at less than 5 fps, and used a keyboard as input. In short, it was the equivalent of flying a very stubborn turkey. But I was hooked. ""One day, I mused - this will be real. One day places will look like it does in the real world. One day planes will feel like planes, not just an illusion of something clearly being tortured on a screen. Finally,  37 years later, 'one day' is here. I can nitpick little flaws in this game, like the fact that the frame rate is inconsistent, and it slows down substantially around massive built up areas, or that the drone camera system is somewhat cumbersome and flight planning could be a lot more user friendly when adding or re-ordering waypoints. But these are minor. And  though I am sure they will be ironed out, I could also live with the game as is, because all the rest is just so far ahead of anything else I've ever seen. It not just great, its phenomenal. I've been a hopeless pilot, trying my best for years and years, and I'm still rubbish at it. However, this simulator is a quantum leap from the ones before. I can actually land every time without crashing when realism is maxed out.  The actual simulation of flight systems and avionics has been vastly improved, making it so much easier to hand fly aircraft  than in previous iterations.  It actually feels like you are flying a plane, not a simulation.  It actually feels like you are in your hometown when flying over it. (And no - that house you are flying into looks nothing like your actual house. In fact it could be mine.  )Sometimes a product comes along that changes everything about its genre. This will change flight simulation forever. This is groundbreaking.So seeing this being delivered before I get to go to that big refrigerator in the sky,  makes me so unbelievably happy. It gives me untold pleasure to admit: ""Its finally here and its better than I ever imagined possible""I'm not going to complain about a single thing, when, for $60, I can go fly anywhere in a faithfully recreated virtual copy the world. Fly over a place and exclaim: ""This actually does look like it does in real life."" How ungrateful would I be If I lamented the hours and hours it took to download, when, by the end of it, the whole world exists on a little setup in the corner of my lounge.  Honestly, some people.I am one very happy gamer today. Always knew this day would come. It did, and its simply mind blowing.",Recommended

																I'll post a full review later but just wanted to warn anyone out there that after buying the game you download a ~600MB launcher. The game itself is a ~90GB download from that launcher. The problem is, the launcher being open appears to being counted as play time, so just a heads up if you were thinking to return it if you don't like it. But, based on everything I've seen, it's clear that this is going to be a phenomenal sim, but just wanted to let people know.Also, for those of you, like me, who are installing this to a secondary drive, note that your main drive (C:\) will need to have at least 8.4GB free as it uses a ""Rolling Cache"" that's located in %AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft Flight SimulatorEdit: Earlier I said that it “appears” that the launcher being open counts as play time. I can now confirm that it DEFINITELY counts as play time. Left machine running overnight to download and install and came back to learn that Steam thinks that I’ve been a pilot for 7 hours. Just 243 more and I’ll get my CPL!For those of you who want to leave and let it install, at least in my case, I came back and it looked as though the launcher had frozen at 15% (that’s where I left it when I locked my PC). I exited the launcher and reopened Microsoft Flight Simulator via Steam to learn it had fully installed. Important thing to note, I didn’t put my PC to sleep overnight, I just locked it and made sure it wouldn’t automatically put itself to sleep by changing the sleep setting in Windows Settings.",Recommended

																I'm a sport pilot so fly in real life, here's what I can tell everyone else about VR and MSFS2020.  Using a reverb G2 and flight yoke and throttle.1) It easy to complain.... this building does not belong here, or it has to many levels, or my airport is not depicted just right - but when you step back and look at the big picture this is a gigantic leap forward for flight simmers.2) I fly VFR in real life and mostly public airports, I can tell you that the at times tonight for moments I literally lost reality and felt like I was flying in real life, the sim can be that realistic, of course the wind, noise, and vibrations-turbulence are missing from the feedback, but in VR it immerses the senses even more making those points above even less noticeable while flying.3) I am amazed how good VR is, how good the sim is compared to real life and again while it would be easy to complain about various things - wow a jump forward for flight simmers! There are times while in the traffic pattern I'll turn downwind, base, or on final and look down and out the window and I get that same feeling as real flying, I literally forget I'm in the sim because the terrain and building match up close enough to trick the mind. Performance wise it may be running better in VR than on my triple screens, still to be determined.Some things I would like to see improved:- Load the obstacles databases so that we have radio and water towers where they should be at the proper heights.- Maybe this already exists but need the ability to turn off road car decals - those have never appealed to me- Runway lights in the middle of many airport taxiways- Multiple ATC voice change options- Better data for the smaller airports, many have hangers, FBO's, or other vital landmarks missing. Example at airport 02a the FBO, one set up of public hangers, and Tuskegee Airman hanger is missing, not sure how because that is certainly big enough to show up on maps. The closer to real life they can make this that much more immersive it's going to be for those who have flown over areas.- Would like the weight shift trike added to the planesAll in all very pleased, specific to VR very impressed! The fact it can make me forget I'm at a computer at times and not in the actual plane is something no flight sim as done before. I highly recommend this and can tell you from a visual perspective it's highly realistic and in VR that much more immersive.  Highly recommended but don't buy from Microsoft if you want to use Reshade because they lock you out of the executable, had to cancel gamepass and buy the game on steam in order to play it the way I wanted.",Recommended

																Before you buy the game here, I'd recommend that you try it through the Xbox Game Pass where you can get it for $1 a month on your first month, otherwise $6 a month. If you download it through Xbox Game Pass, you can also use the downloaded files through the launcher on the Steam version if that is how you want to go about it later on. The sim itself is fantastic and I feel that it was well worth the wait. I'll update this with a full review later on when I get more hands on experience with the simulator.----Updated Full Review as of 2020-08-20After testing the simulator for a fair bit of time, I wanted to give my inputs on how I feel about the simulator. Microsoft Flight Simulator graphically speaking, is simply the best we've had in a flight simulator. For the longest time, clouds rendered in simulators like P3D or X-Plane 11 were 2D and flat (albeit now P3D has TrueSky which significantly improves their clouds) but with FS2020, we are finally able to get an overhaul to one of the most significant problems in flight simulation. The weather system is great but has a flaw that I've seen. The METAR will sometimes be outdated by 1 hour and show weather that is not representative of what the weather actually is at a certain airport. It can sometimes be significantly behind or sometimes be accurate to the weather currently at an airport but hopefully with time, these issues will be sorted out with their weather provider meteoblue. The gusts however are great with the frequency being shown and able to be adjusted. Gives the wind a more ""alive"" feel.The aerodynamics have been improved from the days of FSX and P3D. In those sims, it felt as if you were on rails. The aerodynamics are not comparable to X-Plane 11 which I feel has the better flight model (though it does feel too exaggerated). Flying in the third person camera however feels kind of arcade-like which is dislike but I enjoy flying more in the cockpit than I do flying in the third person camera. I feel the aerodynamics will need some work done on them as planes tend to be tail heavy in my experience with them pitching up too much upon touchdown.The biggest selling point to the game in my opinion is the use of satellite imagery and AI to create autogen. The ground scenery is some of the best ever seen in a flight simulator to date. It uses Bing Maps which is not as good as Google Maps in my opinion but it does the job well enough to make for a realistic experience.Some of the aircraft have problems with autopilots not functioning correctly, missing features in the GPS systems such as in the G1000 where it can make it difficult or near impossible to fly with them on networks like PilotEdge or VATSIM, and just general performance issues. They look really nice but don't have the greatest functionality but they are just default aircraft so it is to be expected that not everything works in them. They should however, try to make really good avionics. Kind of like how X-Plane 11 has a fully functional G1000, GNS430 and GNS530 avionics systems as they work really well and are included by default. Most payware planes will end up using the default avionics and having strong base avionics is a must in a simulator in my opinion.The biggest problem I have with the simulator is how buggy and unoptimized the simulator is. I feel that the simulator needed more time to be ironed out with the bugs (such as not being able to click anything in the cockpit upon loading it up) and the performance issues (only 50% gpu usage in the A320 cockpit, glass cockpits suffer hard on performance). The game really needs you to have a beefy computer to run it optimally. The best place to test your performance is in a major city like KJFK.Overall, I'm enjoying the simulator and love to just fly around with my friends and do FSEconomy flights here and there. It is an enjoyable experience so far and with the team wanting to support the game for a long time, I have hope that many of these issues will be fixed.",Recommended

																I haven't reached level 60 yet (I'm close, at 54), but I'm already feeling a bit burned out thanks to a myriad of weird design choices on AGS' part. For starters, there's no ingame restriction so that a faction can't control 90% of the land, thus disabling 90% of the endgame content (faction warfare). On the server I'm playing right now, my own faction owns all but two cities, and this is mostly due to a big clan from another game just showing up in numbers and creating like 8 clans that just steamroll everything. End result? You can't play in a war if you aren't from one of their companies, you can't really do large scale PvP because almost no one from other factions bothers to go outside with PvP on, and you can't even play the PvE invasions, because the ruling clan will abuse the kick mechanic to select 50 players instead of the 10 they should be selecting.Even if we don't consider these issues, there's a lot of other stuff going on that is slowly eroding my patience. Imagine you go into a dungeon with your friends, fight all the way to the end, then one of your party dies when the final boss is at 5% HP. Guess what you have to do if you want everyone to be able to complete their dungeon quest/get loot? Yeah, you need to force a wipe because the game won't let that other player get their stuff or complete their missions. Who thought that was a good idea?Or imagine you put your stuff up for sale on a town that has lower taxes, then while you are visiting another area which has extreme taxes, that item sells. Guess what? You'll get charged the extreme taxes, even if the item was actually sold on the lower taxes area. Why? Ask AGS, because it makes zero sense to me.I'll keep going for a while because the game has a lot of potential, but so far, it feels like it squanders more and more with every passing week.",Not Recommended

SummaryI have 280+ hours in this game as of writing. I started day 2 or 3, basically as soon as launch day queues settled. I play on Utensia, a good middle-pop server (~1,000 players peak, no queues) with all factions viable. I level capped, have a high gear score watermark, am officer of a PvP company that holds territory, and run all end-game content (war, invasions, raids, pvp arena.) I am at the end of the rainbow. There is no pot of gold. It's just a buggy mess, unfulfilled promises, and devs too busy working to implement server transfers to actually fix the game.Several features are broken. Several systems are broken. Servers are dying.Bottom line: the game isn't finished and you're already late to the party. Save your money.Why have you played so much if it's bad?I got in early, so I'm on the bleeding edge of the power curve on the server. I got to be a part of all the server firsts (buying territory, early wars, first invasion, outpost rush, etc).Unfortunately, you will never have this experience because these experiences are dead. There are no new servers and existing ones never reset. War outcomes never change (see more on that below.) The economic snowball rolls downhill. Until the level or Gear Score cap rise, new players simply cannot catch server leaders. Amazon hasn't announced when an expansion will come, but I highly doubt many players will be around to see it. If you start now, you can still grab the fruit, but other players have wrung out all the juice.The ExploitsA month in, there have been game-breaking exploits that:- Made players invulnerable in PvP- Duped hundreds of thousands of gold upon server transfer- Power-leveled players because of stupidly high respawn rates in one area- Force victory in an event (war or invasion) by glitching out adding/removing players from the event- Caused the premier end-game PvP mode, Outpost Rush, to be enabled for less than 4 hours since launch.- Prevented players from clearing Tier 5 corruption, then over-rewarded players for doing so- Cause opponents to lag out in Wars by using AoE spellsTo fix these, Amazon has (in order) issued a patch within a couple days, stopped server transfers, cut respawn rate, done nothing but hope it doesn't go viral, disabled the mode, disabled the rewards, and done nothing.Focus on that last one: Ice Gauntlet and Life Staff are key PvP War weapons because they provide AoE DOT/crowd control and AoE HOT. PvP War is fought over control points, meaning up to 100 players can surround and fight for a single point. Stacking these spells always results in players on the point lagging out, unable to move or attack. Every war devolves into throwing AoE (and lagouts) back and forth between the two sides until one of them dies while lagged. This takes forever to resolve and are thus wars are basically impossible for attackers to win.Make no mistake: the PvP war experience sucks. If you're melee, you literally aren't playing half the time. Amazon has done nothing to address this.This game isn't even close to finished.The BugsThere are hundreds of niggling bugs floating around this game. Some of them are dumb and bad. Some of them should never have cleared playtesting. None of them should still exist. Som examples:The animation for the 250 Strength perk means you need to stay at 249. The Fire Staff's Pillar of Flame randomly casts centered on you, rather than your aimer. The healing interface on Life Staff is a mess. These affect the core loop of the game: combat.Attempting to interact with an object that's being interacted with by another player (like closing a corruption portal) glitches out your auto-run. Players found a way to restore it; THEY HAD TO BECAUSE IT HAPPENS SO G*D D*MN ALWAYS.Settlements don't correctly report the levels of their crafting/refining stations on the Map.Many in-game tooltips are just factually incorrect (light armor!)The most annoying bug of all, however, is resource tracking. In lieu of minimap, there's a compass HUD that indicates the presence of resources nearby. As you level gathering skills, nearby resources are automatically tracked on your HUD. Except when they aren't. Sometimes, tracking just glitches and stops working at random. Oops! The kicker is, this feature is garbage. You don't need it. Resource spawn locations aren't randomized. They could've avoided this bug by removing the feature they failed to implement.Many of these existed in beta; why aren't they fixed by Patch #3?Design IssuesThere are several break points in even the Main Quest. There are three required 5-man raids but no LFG system beyond a chat channel. Inexplicably two main quest bosses are difficult/impossible to solo, but also exist behind doors that require a player to have the quest to enter. As players finish, they can no longer help players behind them. The final boss needs at least 5 players to kill reliably under 10 minutes, even at level 60. Naturally, there's an exploit that makes it possible for ranged characters to solo it. Betting that will get patched before Wars get fixed.Combat feels promising, but the interaction between animation canceling, action buffering, and server responsiveness just feels bad. Take Fire Staff: if you cast and hold LMB (heavy attack) before the animation finishes, you will do nothing after. If you cast and hold RMB to block, you will block immediately after. Factor in potions, weapon swaps, enemy abilities, lag, etc, and it all produces a very cludgy system that rewards micro mechanics more than macro mechanics like ability choices, combos, dodging, and aim. Of course, even if you sort this out, sometimes you'll cast a spell on your own head. Get wrecked, PvP mages.Kotaku is writing articles about in-game deflation. The economy sucks.FactionsThis was the killer feature: actual, meaningful, inter-faction conflict. A company (guild) controls a territory for as long as it can, then another company comes along to knock them off their perch and take their lands. Every few weeks, the map changes with the ebbs and flows of PvP warfare and political maneuvering. Right? Right? Wrong.This started on Day 1. On most servers, the faction that controls Everfall controls the whole server because it's a central starting zone for crafting/refining. Everfall generates the most taxes and funds the most upgrades, cementing its status as the hub of the world. With those taxes, the controller buys additional territories and snowballs the map. OK, that's fine. That's what war is for.But war is bugged. As stated above, attackers have little chance of winning. As time passes, territories upgrade their defenses, making it even harder. There are zero meaningful catch-up mechanics to encourage turnover. As controlling companies fill, new players can't even participate.There are real benefits to being the majority faction: cheaper fast travel, trading/crafting discounts, more XP and rep. New players can see the map is purple, join purple, and level easier/faster. Existing players cannot switch to the winning faction. This further snowballs and cements status quo unless companies deliberately engineer other outcomes. Cool feature.OverallIt's an MMO. There are 4 kinds of quests. There are a couple dozen types of enemies and move sets, most of them barely even reskinned from the same ones you've seen a dozen times. The raid bosses are interesting, but most enemies you'll see a thousand times throughout questing. The crafting system is expansive, but the economy is borked. Storage is scarce. You can decorate your house. After ~300 hours, I'm pot committed on the idea this game might get fixed. If you're reading this, you can do something else with your time. You probably should.There are no mounts, but there is a lot of walking. At least there's auto-run... assuming it hasn't glitched out.",Not Recommended

																I cant recommend this game. Review below.Pros:1. Great graphics2. Great sound design3. Combat is fairly funCons:1. Economy: The economy is screwed. Its beyond saving. High level resources sell for nothing, crafted gear is worthless and doesnt sell as mobs drop insane amounts of gear. Gold dries up at level 60 as new gold is only obtained via the main quest level and side quests. The only way to make gold is the trading post but the only things that sell are tier 1 resources. So with the many taxes its a race to the bottom, you'll live in poverty. I believe this has been done on purpose so amazon can sell gold.2. Death and taxes. Taxes and repair costs are through the roof. For my house i have to pay 2000 gold every 5 days, add on all the other taxes and repair costs its a miserable experience. I feel like im paying rent and taxes IRL.3. Gathering: This was once a Pro for me, until you realise that 90% of the stuff you gather is worthless. The only valuable goods are tier 1 resources because of how broken the high end loot system and crafting is. For instance there are wolfs that you can kill on mass that drop the high end epic quintessence. These were once 80g a piece, i can now buy a batch of 1000 for 0.09 gold each.4. Crafting: Its worthless. Theres too much gear in the game. Anything you craft will sell for nothing. Apparently your crafting might become useful at level 200 with a full crafting gear and foods. But its only a tiny upgrade to the gear you can loot. To give you an idea of how much loot there is, i AOE farmed for 2 hours and probably got about 40 epics, 100 blues and 200 green item.5. PVP and PVE events. You'll never get to play them its gated to a very small part of the player base.6. Bugs and exploits. There are so many bugs and exploits which completely break the game. 7. Toxic player base8. This game needs a 1000 Quality of life fixes. Theres too many to put here.9. No NPC variety. You'll fight the same NPC's at level 1 that you do at level 60.10. Storyline and lore sucks, you'll skip through it all.",Not Recommended
New World,"Posted: 16 October
																There's a lot to love about this game, but ultimately I can't recommend it because it APPEALS NEITHER TO CASUAL NOR HARDCORE PLAYERS.Casual players are locked out the most fun parts of the game - wars for territory control. I was one of the 50 players that was picked for each and every one of my faction's wars for the first 3 weeks of this game. The other 1,850 players on the server had to sit on the bench, but they couldn't even watch the war for fear of stream sniping. Furthermore the game is a real grind which is hard for casual players to get into.Hardcore players are at first real excited by the grind, until they realize that endgame itemization has few options, bugs, and a real scarcity of gold/azoth required to grind. Furthermore, those who do strive to stay at the top of the Gear Score and get invited to wars are soon disappointed by the war meta, which is an ongoing game of EXPLOIT THE LATEST BUG. Much like politics, it's not the team with greater coordination or skill that wins wars, but whoever is willing to cheat the best. Somehow, astonishingly, wars have gotten laggier and laggier as the game has gone on, with recent wars reduced to complete and utter standstills in which you have no information to respond to, only random deaths and loss of objectives. Like FPS games, most of the damage/hit calculations are seemingly performed on the client side, which is ripe for abuse.The scope of Amazon Game Studio's work is ambitious, but the reach fundamentally exceeds the grasp.Edit: Thank you for all the awards. Yes, I know it seems silly that I've continued to play it so long without recommending it...but the fact is I play it because it's addictive, and several of my IRL friends have asked for my help leveling up to endgame, not necessarily because I'm having a lot of fun right now. There is a decent challenge to some things, but mostly it's a sense of masochism and obsessiveness driving me on. Are those characteristics by which to recommend? No. No they are not.",Not Recommended
New World,"Posted: 4 October
New World, at launch, is a mixed bag. My review will be based on making it to level 20, and only playing PVE. The Great (Exploration, Combat, Crafting/UI)1. Exploration is new and exciting. The map is sizable and it feels there is always another area to check out. The zones are ""level recommended"" (meaning you may be toasted by mobs if you're not prepared for some zones). I personally don't mind this. I ran in to a more advanced area without realizing and died to an alligator. I'm still laughing about it. Having level recommendations leaves some areas ""fresh"" to explore as I level up. The starter areas do lack in biodiversity. While the world is bright and colorful, it does not change much - expect many trees and rocks. 2. Combat is a lot of fun. It is fluid and relies on dodging, blocking and doing damage. I found it very engaging. You can mow through low level mobs, but have to take those above your level more seriously. Leveling weapons unlocks skills and from there you can respec at any time toward being more of a tank, healer, or DPS. 3. The crafting in-game is extensive. There is a lot of materials to gather and several different 'crafting categories' to level up (mining, logging, harvesting, etc). I found the UI to be clean and unobtrusive. When I wasn't leveling weapons or progressing the story, I enjoyed harvesting materials and leveling crafting. Its hard to explain, but its rather fun and peaceful. A note on the UI - there is a LOT of room for improvement as far as adding group/party indicators, buffs/debuffs, etc.The Middle-Ground (Quests/Story)1. The game does have quests. However the quests are, frankly, bland. The main story mostly makes sense but its not quality. Essentially its a corrupted world and you - The Hero - (plus the 1,000 other players milling around) is the one who can stop it. The side quests are very basic fetch/kill/loot quests without any real narrative. There are journal pages to gather but they don't add to the world. I find I'm not driven to get back in the game simply to see, ""what happens next in the story."" As someone who enjoys the story in games, I did find this rather disheartening.The Not-So-Great (Traveling, Encumbrance, Storage)1. I'm sure I've seen someone call this a ""jogging simulator"" and they're not wrong. I've been back and forth across the main starter areas more times than I can count. Without much feeling of the terrain changing around me it did quickly become a blur of color where I lost touch with the feeling of immersion. There is also a distinct lack of ""atmosphere"". I'm not sure what the best fix for this is, but at least, please, fix the jump.There is fast travel, but it uses the same resource needed for crafting. The good news is you get this resource frequently - the bad news is, if you need to move around a lot, say for storage reasons (see below) you will go through the resource quickly. 2. Encumbrance and storage are kind of tied together. Here's the deal, your personal storage box is tied to each settlement. There are 10+ settlements in the game which means you will eventually have 10+ storage boxes. You can view all of them, but you can only move items around (for a cost) if your faction controls both the settlement you're in AND the settlement you want to withdraw from. I.....can't.....even begin to explain how frustrating this makes inventory management.----------------------------------In summary, I'd call this a bare bones MMO. It has a great combat system, plenty of loot and there's a good level progression. If someone is looking to enjoy a new open-world this has a lot of potential for the price point. I have also heard the PVP is enjoyable but my closest encounter was a random duel with another player. I really can't speak to the PVP element. New World does suffers a lot of small frustrating flaws which desperately need a Quality of Life upgrade. There is a LOT of room for them to expand here with new story and new zones to explore. The flaws can get cumbersome and annoying at times to the point I've logged off because I didn't want to deal with inventory management or running the same road up the hill outside First Light again. If someone is looking for a game that's polished and frustration-free, there are other, more established MMOs they should check out first.",Recommended

																Greetings from Bulgaria! I am Vulkk (or Alex) and I have been playing SWTOR since one of its beta stages without breaks and time outs. I would like to encourage you to give the game a try with this quick review below, while still being honest about the flaws of the game in its ""elderly age"".Star Wars: The Old Republic is now nine years old at the time of this publication. The game has an incredible amount of content to offer to a new player. The learning curve is not too steep and the stories are all free to enjoy them at your own pace.All the way up to level 60 is currently available 100% free of charge. You can play all 8 origin class stories to level 50, and continue through the first digital expansions of the game up to level 60.If you enjoy playing casually, you could only subscribe for a month to get all of the story content unlocked forever for your account. However, once you approach the EndGame, you start feeling the limitations of the F2P model very hard. Once you find out what it is like to play as a Subscriber, you may struggle to get back to Preferred status player (the middle limitation level) after your Sub expires.SWTOR offers tons of solo content, but it shines in the group play, especially if you team up with guildies and have a voice chat available. Be it casual or hardcore, raiding, PvPing, exploration, Conquest - everything is more fun with friends in this game. Play the class stories alone to immerse yourself fully into them, then join a guild or play with friends once you find yourself in the EndGame grind.Being a nine years old game, SWTOR struggles to offer continuously fresh and engaging content to some of the hard-core fans and veterans of the game. I myself have been playing it since beta and have witnessed every single  update, change, bright moments and failures over the years. It's a thing to consider, but if you are reading this review, you are probably wondering if it's worth picking up the game. Yes, absolutely.The game engine is a giant issue from the very beginning. Low FPS in group environment such as Operations and Warzones may be frequent and the graphics of the game in the old content really shows how long it's been since SWTOR's release. BioWare is dedicated to updating the old content slowly from time to time.Enjoy your own Star Wars Saga with fully voiced over cinematic story experience and personal choices that some times lead to real consequences down the line.",Recommended

																I've been playing this game for years and I'm very happy to see it come to Steam! I don't know exactly how many hours I actually have, but I'm sure it's well over 3-4,000. Sometimes that is a mark of shame, and sometimes that is a mark of pride. Is it still worth playing? Hell yes. I've been playing for many years and I still find stuff to do every single day. Will you enjoy your time? That's for you to find out. Everyone is different and what people look for in MMOs is no exception. IMO, this is one of the greatest MMOs ever made, but that does not mean it isn't without flaws. The content releases are few and far between (but there is so much already here that's not necessarily an issue), sometimes EA has been known to flex their cash shop muscle in annoying ways, and I won't lie, this community is one of the more toxic ones I've been apart of. There are some very good people who play and will give you the world, but there are also a ton who will put you down for breathing the wrong way. Turn chat off when you're not enjoying group content and you'll probably be much happier.If you like Star Wars and a decent storyline, you will love this game and all of its branching paths. Even after finishing the 8 class stories, there are ways to play those stories differently on a second run. It's entirely possible to lose yourself while creating alternate characters, and imo, that's a great thing. Also it should be mentioned this is probably the only MMO where you can bang several NPCs. Yes, that is an important feature. Bioware did not forget their hopeless romantics and perverts. Just saying.First, a few bits of advice: If you subscribe once, you get all current content permanently and that is a LOT of content. After you do so, if it's only the access to content you're after, you no longer need to keep subscribing.The free to play version was improved recently and now you can have up to 1 million credits at a time. This will still get you decently far even in the game's current economy. Get a legacy bank and put your money inside of it. This bank is legacy-wide, meaning you can access it on multiple characters. You can do this by buying the Dromund Kaas or Coruscant stronghold (it's very cheap) and placing the one you get in the mail anywhere inside of your room. (Note, you may need to level your legacy a little bit.) When you're about to go over 1 million credits, store it there.ADD THE SECURITY KEY APP TO YOUR PHONE AND CONNECT IT TO YOUR ACCOUNT! You get 100 free cartel coins (cash shop currency) every single month. That is a big deal. It adds up quickly. You will not regret it.When you first make a new character, press Y. They don't tell you to do this. Make a legacy, give yourself a last name for all your characters. Do it ASAP, because you'll want to level that baby. It's important.If you do subscribe, don't waste your time in the cash shop. Everything in the cash shop you can get in the game without spending real money by simply farming credits. There are many, many, many ways to farm quickly, but there is a guide by swtorista which explains it best. Go find her and watch a bunch of her videos, she's great.The real value in this game are the 8 class stories and the DLC story content. This is not an MMO where the end game actually matters or will even go anywhere. If you find a friend group interested and they're fun to get involved with, fine, but if you're not enjoying the storylines there is very little point to playing. Don't skip the cutscenes the first time around. Give this one a fighting chance.When you're leveling, even on free to play you can skip most of the side quests (there are a ton of them). Stick to the story and do all the heroics on every planet. You'll get the gear you need and likely be appropriate level.Each class has a buff they can share with other people. When you finish a class story, you can use that buff on other classes. This is why some people can share all 4 buffs at once. If you're enjoying the game, leveling each class type (only 4--BH = Trooper, SW = JK, Agent = Smuggler, Inq = Consular) might be a decent goal to keep in mind.And finally: Don't fall in love with Quinn. He's a jerk. (Kidding.)If you ever want to know more, check out swtorista's guides, she's an old gem and has a whole series dedicated to the Steam players coming in. This game isn't terribly complicated to get into or even play (especially for people who are familiar to MMOs), but they might help should you need it.I hope you enjoy your time!

																Having played this game for nearly 1000 hours now, here's what I can say.The good : - An incredible amount of content. Even if you're not planning to subscribe, you still get access to 8 class stories, who take anywhere from 15 to 100 hours each depending on how fast you go through them and if you do side missions. Then there's the usual MMORPG content, 4 man dungeons (called flashpoints), 16 man raids (operations) and world bosses all with different difficulty levels.- Quality of writing / storytelling. The story in this game is amazing and stands far above any other MMO I've played. It's essentially high quality Bioware single player writing, but in an MMO. Some class stories stand out, like the Bond-esque Agent story, or the classic overpowered sith story of the warrior. Whoever you are, you'll find a story that suits your style.- A combat system with suprising depth. A lot of classes that feel clunky at first get those clunky abilities replaced as you level up and when you reach max level ""alacrity"" (increase attack speed) makes everything fluid and fast. I was quite suprised, coming from WoW and having also played Tera a lot.- An immersive world with incredible music and suprisingly good graphics, despite it's age.- You can live your childhood (or adulthood!) fantasy of being a jedi or sith lord, with your own lightsaber and very cool armor set that you can customize.- The companion system is quite fleshed out, even if it got simplified over the years from what I read. Your class story will give you access to 5 companions and you can gather more. By the time you reach where the SWtoR story is at now, you'll have a few dozens. Companions can all be geared up with the oufits of your choice and story companions all interact with you and have different personalities and preferences.- The subscription system is fairly good. If you subscribe once (15$) you will be a preferred member once your sub runs out, still giving you access to more content and features, so that's definitely worth it. If you never sub, however, your adventure will end shortly after the class stories (which can easily give you up to 500 hours of fun if you do all 8..!), you will not be able to hit max level and will be capped at 1 million credits (which isn't that much once you start getting really into the game). <-- edit : Upon reflection, I moved the subscription system from ""meh"" to ""good"".The meh :- Fun and high skill cap pvp. Because of alacrity and the pacing at max level, pvp is quite engaging. Everyone gets a built in pvp trinket in their kit, and interrupt and a stun. It's not incredibly balanced, but most classes should have one spec that works. There is however a bad side to pvp in this game, people are toxic as ♥♥♥♥ in ranked (the most toxic community I've encountered so far), and I'm warning you as someone who reached the highest level of PvP in quite a few mmo's and played online games with a ""PvP mindset"" for the past 25 years (first by griefing people in diablo 1 as a 10 year old kid and getting Gladiator a few times in WoW during college. Yeah I'm a boomer.).- The gearing system is quite linear. Once you hit max level, you'll want to get your item level to 306, and anything you do in the world will drop gear near your current average item level. This means that you could solo your way to a fully optimized set of gear. Of course, if you party up and run group content this process will go faster. Once you hit 306 (max item level currently) you can hoard those items and twink your fresh lvl 75 alts, putting them in best in slot gear instantly. This is either good or bad depending on the type of player you are. If you're hoping to be one in a million in BiS gear because it's locked behind hard raids, you'll be dissapointed.- The tab target combat system is tied and true, but dated. I don't mind it, as long as the game is responsive when I use abilities, but for some people it can be boring. This game is no Tera / BDO as far as combat goes, that's for sure.The bad : - While there are cool looking sets that can drop for you from running content, the coolest armors (and boy are they dope) are all real money cosmetics. Unless you want to shell out the credits and buy them from people who used real money in the first place. Admittedly, the cash shop is probably what's keeping the lights on this game.- Speaking of using real cash, while gearing is so easy it's impossible to call it pay to win, it's definitely pay to get rich. By spending 10$ you can buy a store item that you can then resell for somewhere around 150 million credits, which is quite a lot, but won't get you one of the best looking lightsabers that go for 500-600 million credits (or 50$ on the store!). Again, purely cosmetic. You could be using an ugly wooden lightsaber and it would do the exact same damage with proper mods.- I just mentionned credits. This games economy is insanely inflated and it's not gonna get better. People who get rich in this game (billionnaires) either use real money and resell items or play the GTN (auction house) on a daily basis.All in all, I'm  happy I picked this game up. The last time I spent so much time on an mmo was in the better days of WoW. SWtoR has it's flaws, but it's definitely an epic game with an insane amount of high quality content. You should at the very least pick it up and run the class stories for free. I haven't even gotten through all of them yet either!",Recommended

																I have over 3,000 hours in the other version. I love this game and have completed almost all of the content available. You can definitely get the same amount of time or more out of this game. If you need help getting started, I am willing to help. Just leave your name and server in the comments.Not subbing will slow progress a good bit but as a new player it might be of benefit. You will be able to experience every single quest and story in the game without overleveling. The biggest annoyance of ftp is the credit limit and group content restrictions. In all honesty you can live without subbing as a new player until you get to around level 60, then it is of benefit to sub for a single month. But without subscription as long as you complete the main class quest and the planetary quest line you will easily be on track for leveling. Also make sure to use your legacy bank for any money that you acquire while unsubbed as that is the only way you can transfer money to other characters on your account. The legacy bank is uncapped also. Subbing will also let you use artifact gear which is super important to the progression in the endgame. I would suggest subscribing then picking that up with the cartel coins you are granted so you can enjoy the endgame better.",Recommended

																I have played this game off and on since release, I would guess 700 total hours or more.  This game has had numerous updates over the years, but I will tailor this review to newer players.  First, this game in very welcome to newer players, but I would suggest ignoring the general chat on starter worlds.   Second, this game is fair to play.  Whether you sub or not, most of the pay options are cosmetic only.  If you subscribe for a single month, once you revert to free to play, you will be a preferred and keep a lot of the benefits.    Third,  Being a subscriber is my preferred way to play.  You can level using only the class story and never have to grind sidequests to stay within level requirements, most of the time you will end up being downleveled to the content as you will be over the max level for the region.  The class stories are all fantastic, and if you don't have to grind to keep up, you will feel like you have 8 full KOTOR quality games.  The PVE Experience is great, to include raids (Operations) and dungeons (Flashpoints) with an easy to use groupfinder and difficulty that allows all ranges of capable and experiences of players.  PVP is good, multiple ways to get involved in PVP to include matches of Huttball, Spaceship combat, world PVP and ranked matches.  The ranked stuff can get cutthroat and is best experienced with a group of players you know.  My very first recommendations for new players.  1.  Get a security key (free 100 cartel coins monthly, used mostly for cosmetic purchases).  2.  Sub for at least a month.  3.  Get into a guild (most have already unlocked the 10% experience boost).  I highly recommend my own guild of course, Imperial Army on Starforge Server, best group of players I have ever played with accross all my many years of many games www.imperialarmy.org.   and 4.  Experience all the classes to at least level 20 before choosing your main (eventually you are going to want to experience all the class stories, and being subscriber will allow you to do that without breaking up the continuity of lore too much).",Recommended

																I have over 10,000 hours playing this prior to it being released on Steam. I've played it on and off for the past 10 years. It's unfortunate that it's only just now being released on Steam after all this time as I don't know how much more I will continue to play it. I loved it, but at some point I don't know if I could put in another 10,000 hours. (It still gets updates and new content)However, for anyone new to the game, there is a massive ton of content to explore, and don't be turned off by it being an MMO. For players who prefer a single player experience there is still 100's of hours of quality content that can be done alone, friends optional.There are 8 main classes to pick from and each one has many hours of single player story content. You'll be able to progress through all main class story lines either with just your NPC companion or bring along friends instead, or a mix of friends and companions. PVP is optional and completely avoidable.All missions and story content are fully voiced. Voice acting, sound effects and music are movie quality and fit easily into the Star Wars universe. This is quite possibly the game with both the most quality and quantity of voice acting ever created. A huge portion of the games $200+ million dollar budget was spent on voice acting and music production and it shows.Graphically this was among the best looking games of 2011. Visually it is not quite as sharp and polished as some current AAA games now in 2020, but it's still really good looking with the options turned up, and it's fairly low on system requirements so even people with older systems can get it running.Each of the 8 class storylines is a unique chain of events revolving around the larger story and  give extensive replay value to experience it in new ways. Digging further there's also male/female romance story arcs and light/dark personality choices to give additional variables to your experience. I've personally played through more than 16 times to experience every variation and all the different romance, light/dark and so on variables.And if you are into housing there's an extensive choice ranging from apartments to mansions to decorate and if you are rich you can own them all. Get far enough along and your guilds can decorate their own flag ships. (I personally owned entire flag ships outright, fully decorated at the cost of billions in game and years of effort with dozens of friends to unlock.)The depth of both the single player and the group content is some of the most extensive available in any MMO of the past two decades.There's really not much else to say, the game is Free to Play so you can go ahead and at least try it for yourself. There is an optional monthly subscription and it will greatly enhance your fun and is needed to unlock some end game (post class story) content, but you do not need it to start with and can easily see for yourself if you are willing to invest more into the game.Note there are also optional micro-transactions through the Hutt Cartel, but this is purely cosmetics. There is no pay-to-win and it can be completely avoided. Most cosmetics from the Hutt Cartel can also be purchased from other players through the market for in-game credits.If you have any interest in Star Wars, give it a try.---While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?",Recommended

																One of the best single player story MMOs out there. FYI, this is a review from a mostly solo player viewpoint. I've been playing this game very on and off since day 1, so I've seen how it's changed and progressed over the years. Unlike other MMOs, this one has only gotten better with age. There is literally hundreds of hours of single player story content, with solo dungeons and raids for you to do in case you're like me and enjoy playing solo. If you're like me and stopped playing WoW bc of various reasons, I can recommend this game very much.Combat is your standard tab target MMO, but there is an emphasis on player control. By that I mean, you can have a handful of companions that join you and be your tank, dps, or heals. You also can heal yourself at any time, which makes solo content fun. I'm still shocked at how all the non force classes play so well and fit into this SW story so well. I personally like the Smuggler and Bounty Hunter classes the most. You get your own ship, base, and crew that you can deck out how you like.The story is the best part of this game. You have 8 classes (4 Republic, 4 Empire), and all have their own 20 to 30 hour story, depending on how much side content you do. Choices matter and can affect the game in smaller ways. The game makes you feel like you're the champion of each class. You start small then get bigger and bigger in the story.  If you're wanting KOTOR 3, then this is what you need to play. The story is a sequel to KOTOR 2 (loosely), so you'll see certain characters reappearing or being mentioned. The game is F2P, but you're very limited with what you can do if you don't pay. Others have said this, but it's best to sub for just 1 month and then you get put on a preferred status even if you aren't paying anymore, so you still have access to certain features that F2P (never subbed) can't use. The Cartel Market is their cash shop, but there's no P2W features. It's almost all cosmetics, mounts, boosters. But all of these can be still purchased in the in game trade market for high prices. But it's up to you. The game is also new player friendly, with giving you a lot of early tutorials and goodies to show off what you can do right now and at higher levels. Over all, I think in 2021 SWTOR is up there with FF14 in terms of single player content. I don't do any PVP or hardcore raiding, so I can't comment on that part. If you're jonesing for KOTOR 3, realistically you're never going to get it, but this game is about as close to it as we'll ever see. Just do like me and play it solo and just pretend the other players aren't there. :)",Recommended

																I purchased this game specifically to play with my significant other. While we expected it to be good, It Takes Two, the sophomore effort from developer, Hazelight, impressed us so much, it is now the benchmark for which I will measure future co-op game experiences. We simply lost count of how many charming moments we encountered whilst playing.I could go on and on, but, the selling points of this game are best experienced for yourself.Each painstakingly detailed level in this title offers you unique gameplay mechanics that are never recycled. Communication and cooperation are a must, as well as decent twitch response reflexes. Various mini-games are scattered around the environment, and give you a slight reprieve from your main objective, only to get your competitive juices flowing. (sore losers need not apply!) Controls are tight and responsive, and the camera does a decent job of keeping track of the action. However, those who suffer from motion sickness may occasionally become disoriented or even nauseated due to the mandatory split screen. Overall, this is a very high quality, one of a kind experience that could only be produced as a labor of love. Pick this one up, play it with someone special, and let the hilarity ensue.Best neglectful parent simulator, ever.Highly recommended.",Recommended

																I haven't reached level 60 yet (I'm close, at 54), but I'm already feeling a bit burned out thanks to a myriad of weird design choices on AGS' part. For starters, there's no ingame restriction so that a faction can't control 90% of the land, thus disabling 90% of the endgame content (faction warfare). On the server I'm playing right now, my own faction owns all but two cities, and this is mostly due to a big clan from another game just showing up in numbers and creating like 8 clans that just steamroll everything. End result? You can't play in a war if you aren't from one of their companies, you can't really do large scale PvP because almost no one from other factions bothers to go outside with PvP on, and you can't even play the PvE invasions, because the ruling clan will abuse the kick mechanic to select 50 players instead of the 10 they should be selecting.Even if we don't consider these issues, there's a lot of other stuff going on that is slowly eroding my patience. Imagine you go into a dungeon with your friends, fight all the way to the end, then one of your party dies when the final boss is at 5% HP. Guess what you have to do if you want everyone to be able to complete their dungeon quest/get loot? Yeah, you need to force a wipe because the game won't let that other player get their stuff or complete their missions. Who thought that was a good idea?Or imagine you put your stuff up for sale on a town that has lower taxes, then while you are visiting another area which has extreme taxes, that item sells. Guess what? You'll get charged the extreme taxes, even if the item was actually sold on the lower taxes area. Why? Ask AGS, because it makes zero sense to me.I'll keep going for a while because the game has a lot of potential, but so far, it feels like it squanders more and more with every passing week.",Not Recommended

SummaryI have 280+ hours in this game as of writing. I started day 2 or 3, basically as soon as launch day queues settled. I play on Utensia, a good middle-pop server (~1,000 players peak, no queues) with all factions viable. I level capped, have a high gear score watermark, am officer of a PvP company that holds territory, and run all end-game content (war, invasions, raids, pvp arena.) I am at the end of the rainbow. There is no pot of gold. It's just a buggy mess, unfulfilled promises, and devs too busy working to implement server transfers to actually fix the game.Several features are broken. Several systems are broken. Servers are dying.Bottom line: the game isn't finished and you're already late to the party. Save your money.Why have you played so much if it's bad?I got in early, so I'm on the bleeding edge of the power curve on the server. I got to be a part of all the server firsts (buying territory, early wars, first invasion, outpost rush, etc).Unfortunately, you will never have this experience because these experiences are dead. There are no new servers and existing ones never reset. War outcomes never change (see more on that below.) The economic snowball rolls downhill. Until the level or Gear Score cap rise, new players simply cannot catch server leaders. Amazon hasn't announced when an expansion will come, but I highly doubt many players will be around to see it. If you start now, you can still grab the fruit, but other players have wrung out all the juice.The ExploitsA month in, there have been game-breaking exploits that:- Made players invulnerable in PvP- Duped hundreds of thousands of gold upon server transfer- Power-leveled players because of stupidly high respawn rates in one area- Force victory in an event (war or invasion) by glitching out adding/removing players from the event- Caused the premier end-game PvP mode, Outpost Rush, to be enabled for less than 4 hours since launch.- Prevented players from clearing Tier 5 corruption, then over-rewarded players for doing so- Cause opponents to lag out in Wars by using AoE spellsTo fix these, Amazon has (in order) issued a patch within a couple days, stopped server transfers, cut respawn rate, done nothing but hope it doesn't go viral, disabled the mode, disabled the rewards, and done nothing.Focus on that last one: Ice Gauntlet and Life Staff are key PvP War weapons because they provide AoE DOT/crowd control and AoE HOT. PvP War is fought over control points, meaning up to 100 players can surround and fight for a single point. Stacking these spells always results in players on the point lagging out, unable to move or attack. Every war devolves into throwing AoE (and lagouts) back and forth between the two sides until one of them dies while lagged. This takes forever to resolve and are thus wars are basically impossible for attackers to win.Make no mistake: the PvP war experience sucks. If you're melee, you literally aren't playing half the time. Amazon has done nothing to address this.This game isn't even close to finished.The BugsThere are hundreds of niggling bugs floating around this game. Some of them are dumb and bad. Some of them should never have cleared playtesting. None of them should still exist. Som examples:The animation for the 250 Strength perk means you need to stay at 249. The Fire Staff's Pillar of Flame randomly casts centered on you, rather than your aimer. The healing interface on Life Staff is a mess. These affect the core loop of the game: combat.Attempting to interact with an object that's being interacted with by another player (like closing a corruption portal) glitches out your auto-run. Players found a way to restore it; THEY HAD TO BECAUSE IT HAPPENS SO G*D D*MN ALWAYS.Settlements don't correctly report the levels of their crafting/refining stations on the Map.Many in-game tooltips are just factually incorrect (light armor!)The most annoying bug of all, however, is resource tracking. In lieu of minimap, there's a compass HUD that indicates the presence of resources nearby. As you level gathering skills, nearby resources are automatically tracked on your HUD. Except when they aren't. Sometimes, tracking just glitches and stops working at random. Oops! The kicker is, this feature is garbage. You don't need it. Resource spawn locations aren't randomized. They could've avoided this bug by removing the feature they failed to implement.Many of these existed in beta; why aren't they fixed by Patch #3?Design IssuesThere are several break points in even the Main Quest. There are three required 5-man raids but no LFG system beyond a chat channel. Inexplicably two main quest bosses are difficult/impossible to solo, but also exist behind doors that require a player to have the quest to enter. As players finish, they can no longer help players behind them. The final boss needs at least 5 players to kill reliably under 10 minutes, even at level 60. Naturally, there's an exploit that makes it possible for ranged characters to solo it. Betting that will get patched before Wars get fixed.Combat feels promising, but the interaction between animation canceling, action buffering, and server responsiveness just feels bad. Take Fire Staff: if you cast and hold LMB (heavy attack) before the animation finishes, you will do nothing after. If you cast and hold RMB to block, you will block immediately after. Factor in potions, weapon swaps, enemy abilities, lag, etc, and it all produces a very cludgy system that rewards micro mechanics more than macro mechanics like ability choices, combos, dodging, and aim. Of course, even if you sort this out, sometimes you'll cast a spell on your own head. Get wrecked, PvP mages.Kotaku is writing articles about in-game deflation. The economy sucks.FactionsThis was the killer feature: actual, meaningful, inter-faction conflict. A company (guild) controls a territory for as long as it can, then another company comes along to knock them off their perch and take their lands. Every few weeks, the map changes with the ebbs and flows of PvP warfare and political maneuvering. Right? Right? Wrong.This started on Day 1. On most servers, the faction that controls Everfall controls the whole server because it's a central starting zone for crafting/refining. Everfall generates the most taxes and funds the most upgrades, cementing its status as the hub of the world. With those taxes, the controller buys additional territories and snowballs the map. OK, that's fine. That's what war is for.But war is bugged. As stated above, attackers have little chance of winning. As time passes, territories upgrade their defenses, making it even harder. There are zero meaningful catch-up mechanics to encourage turnover. As controlling companies fill, new players can't even participate.There are real benefits to being the majority faction: cheaper fast travel, trading/crafting discounts, more XP and rep. New players can see the map is purple, join purple, and level easier/faster. Existing players cannot switch to the winning faction. This further snowballs and cements status quo unless companies deliberately engineer other outcomes. Cool feature.OverallIt's an MMO. There are 4 kinds of quests. There are a couple dozen types of enemies and move sets, most of them barely even reskinned from the same ones you've seen a dozen times. The raid bosses are interesting, but most enemies you'll see a thousand times throughout questing. The crafting system is expansive, but the economy is borked. Storage is scarce. You can decorate your house. After ~300 hours, I'm pot committed on the idea this game might get fixed. If you're reading this, you can do something else with your time. You probably should.There are no mounts, but there is a lot of walking. At least there's auto-run... assuming it hasn't glitched out.",Not Recommended

																I cant recommend this game. Review below.Pros:1. Great graphics2. Great sound design3. Combat is fairly funCons:1. Economy: The economy is screwed. Its beyond saving. High level resources sell for nothing, crafted gear is worthless and doesnt sell as mobs drop insane amounts of gear. Gold dries up at level 60 as new gold is only obtained via the main quest level and side quests. The only way to make gold is the trading post but the only things that sell are tier 1 resources. So with the many taxes its a race to the bottom, you'll live in poverty. I believe this has been done on purpose so amazon can sell gold.2. Death and taxes. Taxes and repair costs are through the roof. For my house i have to pay 2000 gold every 5 days, add on all the other taxes and repair costs its a miserable experience. I feel like im paying rent and taxes IRL.3. Gathering: This was once a Pro for me, until you realise that 90% of the stuff you gather is worthless. The only valuable goods are tier 1 resources because of how broken the high end loot system and crafting is. For instance there are wolfs that you can kill on mass that drop the high end epic quintessence. These were once 80g a piece, i can now buy a batch of 1000 for 0.09 gold each.4. Crafting: Its worthless. Theres too much gear in the game. Anything you craft will sell for nothing. Apparently your crafting might become useful at level 200 with a full crafting gear and foods. But its only a tiny upgrade to the gear you can loot. To give you an idea of how much loot there is, i AOE farmed for 2 hours and probably got about 40 epics, 100 blues and 200 green item.5. PVP and PVE events. You'll never get to play them its gated to a very small part of the player base.6. Bugs and exploits. There are so many bugs and exploits which completely break the game. 7. Toxic player base8. This game needs a 1000 Quality of life fixes. Theres too many to put here.9. No NPC variety. You'll fight the same NPC's at level 1 that you do at level 60.10. Storyline and lore sucks, you'll skip through it all.",Not Recommended

																There's a lot to love about this game, but ultimately I can't recommend it because it APPEALS NEITHER TO CASUAL NOR HARDCORE PLAYERS.Casual players are locked out the most fun parts of the game - wars for territory control. I was one of the 50 players that was picked for each and every one of my faction's wars for the first 3 weeks of this game. The other 1,850 players on the server had to sit on the bench, but they couldn't even watch the war for fear of stream sniping. Furthermore the game is a real grind which is hard for casual players to get into.Hardcore players are at first real excited by the grind, until they realize that endgame itemization has few options, bugs, and a real scarcity of gold/azoth required to grind. Furthermore, those who do strive to stay at the top of the Gear Score and get invited to wars are soon disappointed by the war meta, which is an ongoing game of EXPLOIT THE LATEST BUG. Much like politics, it's not the team with greater coordination or skill that wins wars, but whoever is willing to cheat the best. Somehow, astonishingly, wars have gotten laggier and laggier as the game has gone on, with recent wars reduced to complete and utter standstills in which you have no information to respond to, only random deaths and loss of objectives. Like FPS games, most of the damage/hit calculations are seemingly performed on the client side, which is ripe for abuse.The scope of Amazon Game Studio's work is ambitious, but the reach fundamentally exceeds the grasp.Edit: Thank you for all the awards. Yes, I know it seems silly that I've continued to play it so long without recommending it...but the fact is I play it because it's addictive, and several of my IRL friends have asked for my help leveling up to endgame, not necessarily because I'm having a lot of fun right now. There is a decent challenge to some things, but mostly it's a sense of masochism and obsessiveness driving me on. Are those characteristics by which to recommend? No. No they are not.",Not Recommended
New World,"Posted: 4 October
New World, at launch, is a mixed bag. My review will be based on making it to level 20, and only playing PVE. The Great (Exploration, Combat, Crafting/UI)1. Exploration is new and exciting. The map is sizable and it feels there is always another area to check out. The zones are ""level recommended"" (meaning you may be toasted by mobs if you're not prepared for some zones). I personally don't mind this. I ran in to a more advanced area without realizing and died to an alligator. I'm still laughing about it. Having level recommendations leaves some areas ""fresh"" to explore as I level up. The starter areas do lack in biodiversity. While the world is bright and colorful, it does not change much - expect many trees and rocks. 2. Combat is a lot of fun. It is fluid and relies on dodging, blocking and doing damage. I found it very engaging. You can mow through low level mobs, but have to take those above your level more seriously. Leveling weapons unlocks skills and from there you can respec at any time toward being more of a tank, healer, or DPS. 3. The crafting in-game is extensive. There is a lot of materials to gather and several different 'crafting categories' to level up (mining, logging, harvesting, etc). I found the UI to be clean and unobtrusive. When I wasn't leveling weapons or progressing the story, I enjoyed harvesting materials and leveling crafting. Its hard to explain, but its rather fun and peaceful. A note on the UI - there is a LOT of room for improvement as far as adding group/party indicators, buffs/debuffs, etc.The Middle-Ground (Quests/Story)1. The game does have quests. However the quests are, frankly, bland. The main story mostly makes sense but its not quality. Essentially its a corrupted world and you - The Hero - (plus the 1,000 other players milling around) is the one who can stop it. The side quests are very basic fetch/kill/loot quests without any real narrative. There are journal pages to gather but they don't add to the world. I find I'm not driven to get back in the game simply to see, ""what happens next in the story."" As someone who enjoys the story in games, I did find this rather disheartening.The Not-So-Great (Traveling, Encumbrance, Storage)1. I'm sure I've seen someone call this a ""jogging simulator"" and they're not wrong. I've been back and forth across the main starter areas more times than I can count. Without much feeling of the terrain changing around me it did quickly become a blur of color where I lost touch with the feeling of immersion. There is also a distinct lack of ""atmosphere"". I'm not sure what the best fix for this is, but at least, please, fix the jump.There is fast travel, but it uses the same resource needed for crafting. The good news is you get this resource frequently - the bad news is, if you need to move around a lot, say for storage reasons (see below) you will go through the resource quickly. 2. Encumbrance and storage are kind of tied together. Here's the deal, your personal storage box is tied to each settlement. There are 10+ settlements in the game which means you will eventually have 10+ storage boxes. You can view all of them, but you can only move items around (for a cost) if your faction controls both the settlement you're in AND the settlement you want to withdraw from. I.....can't.....even begin to explain how frustrating this makes inventory management.----------------------------------In summary, I'd call this a bare bones MMO. It has a great combat system, plenty of loot and there's a good level progression. If someone is looking to enjoy a new open-world this has a lot of potential for the price point. I have also heard the PVP is enjoyable but my closest encounter was a random duel with another player. I really can't speak to the PVP element. New World does suffers a lot of small frustrating flaws which desperately need a Quality of Life upgrade. There is a LOT of room for them to expand here with new story and new zones to explore. The flaws can get cumbersome and annoying at times to the point I've logged off because I didn't want to deal with inventory management or running the same road up the hill outside First Light again. If someone is looking for a game that's polished and frustration-free, there are other, more established MMOs they should check out first.",Recommended

																I'm 64; this is my first RPG. It's great. Certainly not intuitive for a guy that's never played anything like this, but I relished the challenge. I had no idea what I was doing at first: I died many times, and progressed slowly. Used Google for UESP for game info, and that helped tremendously. I made it to Level 83, sort of ran out of things to do, so created a new character, and am playing it differently. I'm a Stormcloak this time around. Enjoying my second go round immensely!",Recommended

																Game was and still is so cool, but what's more remarkable to me is how easy is to look for/install/use the mods this time.I usually play the standard mode, sometimes due to my laziness, but this game has quite a few excellent mods, especially if you are looking for a nice immersion and realism, a couple of things that you couldn't find at the original skyrim. This mixed with the new graphics from the special edition makes it SO enjoyable, even when you role-play warming up for 5 minutes next to a fire pit.Mods i use:- Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition: this fixes most of the bugs of the game- Campfire: Lets you build a campfire and different sorts of tents- Vivid weathers: Over 500+ Weathers with different sounds and adjustable brightness, shadows, etc.- Frostfall: Depending on how difficult you want it, you can even freeze to death and rain makes you be wet and get colder faster-  Wet and Cold: Same thing but mostly for NPCs. Also includes some other features like blurry screen when you look up while it's rainning or snowing.-  Point the way: Since i'm looking for some realism i avoid fast travelling, this is why i got this mod, which shows me the way to every city at every crossroad.- Lampposts of Skrim: Lamp posts on the main roads, but just what is necessary, not plenty of them.- Waves: Now beaches with waves :D- Better horses: Now horses go faster than you by foot, something that makes kind of sense.- Less agressive animals: Just makes less agressive small animals like rats or crabs. Was kind of ridiculous to see a crab trying to fight imperial soldiers.- Hunter's Reward - Better prices: Able to skin and sell pelts for a reasonable price in case you wanna play as a hunter.- iNeed: To eat, to drink and to Sleep is now necessary and rewardable.- Holidays: Skyrim has special days like our christmas and all that stuff- Expanded Carriage Service: Carriage service in places where you couldn't find them before, like Morthal or Dawnstar.- Rich merchants of Skyrim: Merchants have more money to buy, meaning that you don't need to walk around all skyrim to sell the stuff. (1000 septims was humiliating for a merchant TBH)- Run for your lives: When a dragon attacks people run off instead of trying to smack the dragon.- When vampires attack: Same with vampires- The Paarthurnax Dilemma: Lets you spare his life. - Hold border banners: Banners from different holds are placed on their borders, pretty simple but cool enough for me.- Immersive patrols SE: Since there's a civil war going on, it's weird not to see any battle along the way until you join one of the sides of the war. With this mod you can find these fights while you walk around. Make other kind of patrols available, like the dawnguard.- Practice Dummies: You can use them to improve your skill till level 30 out of 100. That means that you don't need to deal with badass foes with the skill ""i barely know how to hold the sword"".- Mammoth Pelts: You can skin mammoths, something that i still don't get why it wasn't allowed in the original game.- Dog followers are Huskies: Makes it cooler and makes sense too since Skyrim is the north.- Whistle: Lets you whistle to the horse to make him come over, avoiding to search for the damn horse every time he flees from a battle.- NPC's Run and Walk at your pace:  exactly what the mod says.- Animal poverty: Animals don't drop gold. Like they have a bank account or something...- Immersive armors: adds different kind of armors and shields. The more smithing perks you got the more armors will show up. (Showed in auxiliary armors)- MamTuskPowderGrind: You can grind  mammoth tusk to make its powder, an ingredient that was so hard to find and wasn't allowed (don't know why) to make it out from the normal tusks.- Fantasy Soundtrack Project: Replaces the original music OR adds its songs to the original music. Just necessary if after all these hundreds of hours you got tired of the original one.- Enhaced blood textures: MORE BLOOD!- Skyland: Landscape texture overhaul- Static Mesh Improvement Mod: Better textures for interiors.- Skyrim better roads: More and better textures for main roads.- Verdant: Better textures for grass.- Blacksmith forge water fix se: Makes the water from the blacksmith look real. Yeah... once you realize you need it.- Realistic water two: Improves A LOT water textures and effects.- Open cities Skyrim: No loading screen when you get into a city (this needs a patch to work with Ineed mod)- Immersive Citizens: their behaviour and dialogues are more real. (needs a patch to work with Open cities)BTW, i got them in this order and all of them work properlySome of the mods are only available on nexusmods, which leads me to my final advise: Download the mod ""noble skyrim"". Improves SO MUCH the city textures and buildings. There's just one problem, it has been ported to special edition but still remains on original skyrim from nexus: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/45807/? There are two options, wait till it's completely ported to SSE or download it manually from original skyrim and install it manually from Nexus Mod Manager as well. It won't show up on the list, but it will be there, so don't worry. There's a patch as well to work properly with SMIM mod (Static Meshes).EDIT: I strongly recommend another mod that i just found out! it's called: Amazing Follower Tweaks SSE, and i found it on nexusmods. Short description: you can have more than 1 follower (which is nice since Campfire mod adds tents up to 4 people) and it's possible to tweak each follower as you wish, like creating different sets of outfits depending on if they are outside or inside a city, setting primary spells, weapons, THEY CAN EVEN RIDE HORSES NOW!! and some other stuff. Check it out here: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4340/?(I got it placed after ""the paarthumax dilemma"")",Recommended
